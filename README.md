# perfume-recommendation-system

## goal
Our goal is to recommend perfumes based on usersâ€™ preferences in scent. We use python to analyze an open-source [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nandini1999/perfume-recommendation-dataset) and then present our information on a website using HTML/CSS.
