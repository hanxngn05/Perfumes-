# perfume-recommendation-system

## Description

### Goal
Our goal is to recommend perfumes based on usersâ€™ preferences in scent. We use python to analyze an open-source [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nandini1999/perfume-recommendation-dataset) and then present our information on a website using HTML/CSS/JavaScript. Another important goal of this project is to practice Git!
### Use Case
Our design allows the user to choose 3 desired scents for their perfume. We use their preferences to then recommend a page of perfumes for them to try! Further expansion of this project would be to allow them to save or like the perfumes shown, load more perfumes, show live prices, and provide links. It would also be ideal to let users choose brands that they like. 

## Milestones
**Milestone 1**: **(done)** Clear project design, cleaning data, make scent page (estimated by end of Tuesday)<br>
**Milestone 2**: **(done)** Based on 1-3 ingredients, recommend perfumes; complete brand page (estimated by noon on Wednesday)<br>
**Milestone 3**: Based on 1-3 brands, recommend 10 perfumes; start recommended perfumes page (estimated by noon on Thursday)<br>
**Milestone 4**: **(done)** Finish recommended perfumes page - touch-up remaining website(estimated by the end of the day on Thursday)<br>
**Milestone 5**: User can load more perfumes(refresh button); choose price cap (stretch goal)<br>
**Milestone 6**: Web-scrape latest prices for perfumes (stretch goal)<br>
