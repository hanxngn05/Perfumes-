Sola Parfum,Di Ser," A tribute to the expanse of space extending from the sky to the flower and fruit laden earth below, Sola, the newest offering from DI SER and perfumer Yasuyuki Shinohara, showcases the natural flora of Hokkaido, Japan with locally sourced and sustainably harvested ingredients from DI SERs own gardens. Starting with aromatic notes of freshly harvested Hokkaido lavender, lemongrass and yuzu, the uplifting scent moves to a floral middle of Japanese rose, magnolia, geranium and jasmine before settling on a spiritual bed of frankincense and myrrh. The spiritual and meditative scent evokes an imagery of a peaceful universe in complete harmony with the bounties of nature and of peace and contentment with its generous offerings."," Lavender, Yuzu, Lemongrass, Magnolia, Geranium, Jasmine, Frankincense, Myrrh",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/788011.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, lavender
A Blvd. Called Sunset Eau de Parfum,A Lab on Fire," There's no way A Lab On Fire could relocate to Los Angeles and not pay tribute to L.A.'s most iconic Boulevard, home to the legendary neon-drenched rock stages of the Strip, the crashing waves of the Palisades, and everything in between. The result is A Blvd. Called Sunset, a bright, fresh, just the right amount of edgy journey across our wild and beautiful city. Bright, fresh bergamot sparkles in a smooth, salty, almond-inflected breeze, while a masculine leaning-floral blend of violet and jasmine combines with a leather that evokes the biker bars and metal clubs so famously captured in Ed Ruscha's seminal photo book. A smooth, intoxicating base of sandalwood, vanilla, and tonka goes down like a perfect mixed drink, comforting and sensual all at once. If you ever get a chance to take a trip down Sunset, there's nothing like it in the world. But the next best thing is a day spent wearing A Blvd. Called Sunset- a perfect tribute to the heart and soul of Los Angeles."," Bergamot, almond, violet, jasmine, leather, sandalwood, vanilla, tonka",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/56719.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Eshu Extrait,PRIN," Eshu, the mischievous god of Yoruba legend, who translates between the gods and all the peoples of earth. Eshu, a groundbreaking 2000 Fall/Autumn collection from the late Alexander McQueen, which inspired Prin Lomros to create this scent. Eshu, the fragrance, a universally fluent dialogue between rich, earthy tobacco, fiery spices, sweet cognac, and touches of animalics, woods, and musk. The synthesis is surprisingly smooth, a powerful yet utterly wearable boozy tobacco with intense, sophisticated resin and spice tones, distinctive and unforgettable. An ingenious juxtaposition of traditional tribal elements and modern twists, Eshu is not to be missed."," Tobacco, hay, elemi, copaiba, olibanum, nutmeg, black pepper, castoreum, atlas cedar, oakmoss, cognac, ambroxan, norlimbanol, cinnamon, cumin seed, ash",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/847005.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, tobacco
Saringkarn Extrait,PRIN," A taste of love and seduction. The value of love between lover, friend and family and humanity. A taste of happiness. Saringkarn, a tribute to the traditional and ancient Thai form of literary composition, is a tantalizing and unique scent somewhere between gourmand, floral, and oriental, where dark and sensual tones of oud, amber, leather, and tobacco gain an alluring, romantic sweetness from beeswax, dark chocolate, and a bouquet of exquisite roses. Sweet, boozy prune gives a cognac-like richness, while a darker smoke note preserves just the right amount of provocative danger. Like any true work of literary genius, it's up to you how to interpret it all."," Saffron, champaca, fir balsam, beeswax, amber, damask rose, rose de mai, tobacco, leather, dark chocolate, prune, oud, musk, oakmoss, ambrette, smoke, incense, ylang ylang",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/847006.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, saffron
L'Homme A La Rose Eau de Parfum,Maison Francis Kurkdjian," Francis Kurkdjian has a talent for making masculines that balance French sophistication with modern style- classic enough to impress, cool enough to wear anywhere. And while he's already given men a sultry, evening rose with Lumiere Noire, his newest release reinvents the masculine rose as a fresh, bright, all-day sexy stunner. L'Homme A La Rose doesn't lack for floral strength, as it's built around a dynamic pair of two of the world's most renowned roses: deep, sweet Damask roses from Bulgaria, and smooth, fresh Centifolia rose from Grasse. A fruity, zesty grapefruit accord accentuates the floral roundness, while a dynamic ambery wood accord blends with aromatic sage for a contemporary, distinctive signature. A rose that any man will want atop his wardrobe, L'Homme A La Rose is a new standard for masculine florals."," Grapefruit, Damascene rose, amber woods accord, sage, Centifolia rose, labdanum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/49890.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, grapefruit
Rozu Eau de Parfum,Aesop," The beauty of Aesop fragrances lies in their ability to elegantly balance between sophistication and naturalism- an Aesop scent is gorgeously refined, yet possessed with an unmistakable and primal connection to the raw materials from which it was created. So it shouldn't surprise anyone to hear that their foray into rose scents is no delicate young flower, but a lush, gorgeously green wild rose with vibrant shiso accords, woods and spice, and a light touch of sophisticated smoke. The rose note is sumptuously romantic, with enough floral fullness to make any rose lover swoon, but the eastern influence of the aromatics and guaiac wood impart a soulful spirituality that set Rozu apart. A beautiful floral that's every bit an Aesop scent, Rozu is a must try for rose lovers."," Rose, shiso, guaiac",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/30156.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, rose
Champs Lunaires Eau de Toilette,Rogue Perfumery," An intangible summer night; Moonlit fields of white flowers.Inspired by Serge Lutens' Tubereuse Crimenelle, and the lusty creamy fruit notes of Piguet's Fracas, Champs Lunaires, was an intense journey for perfumer Manuel Cross, a personal challenge to create a tuberose of satisfying balance -- indolic, green, buttery, creamy, realistic, uplifting."," Tuberose, White Rose Petals, Pomelo, Sandalwood, Coconut Milk, Musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/838010.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, tuberose
Prends-Moi Eau de Parfum,Isabey," Take me.It's a bold and forward statement in any era, and in the early 1930's, when Isabey first released Prends-Mois (as it was called then), it was shockingly controversial- and highly coveted. Now, the iconic scent has been relaunched as Prends-Moi, and we're pleased to report the fragrance housed in the emblematic red bottle has every bit of the passionate romanticism that turned heads almost a century before. Prends-Moi opens with a fiery spark of pink pepper, leading to a lush and daring contrast of florals in the heart- a light, innocent rose intertwined with bold, unapologetically carnal tuberose. The powdered elegance of lipstick is balanced against an almost animalic cocoa, representing a seduction both sophisticated and primal. Erotic, romantic, and classic, Prends-Moi is everything French perfume should be."," Bergamot, pink pepper, raspberry, rose, red satin lipstick, tuberose, cardamom, iris, cocoa, sandalwood, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/27110.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Celestial Eau de Parfum,Electimuss," Heavenly, divine and of the gods. Gazing to the stars, the Romans were keen astronomers naming the planets after gods, and such was their belief in the power and influence of the skies over their destiny that they were also keen devotees of astrology.   The olibanum at the heart of this scent is a light, lemony incense with a conifer undertone, lifted by a spicy rose and underpinned by a warm woody base. Luminous, like the heavenly bodies which inspired it."," Saffron, raspberry, black pepper, olibanum, Indian rose absolut, Bulgarian rose, pepper, cedar, Paraguan guaiac wood, tonka",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/855010.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, saffron
Amber Eau de Parfum,Rook Perfumes," When we say we love amber scents, we don't just mean the traditional blend of labdanum and vanilla that are so often considered the definitive ""amber"" note in perfume. Which is good, because neither ingredient is anywhere to be found in Rook's new Amber scent. What we really love, however, is the spirit of amber- powerful, sensual, spiritual, and comforting, all at once- and that, this Amber has in multitudes. It opens with a genuinely hypnotic smoke note- sweetened with saffron, but rich and animalic, coaxing out the syrupy amber-maple heart like semi-fossilized resin seeping from ancient bark. A tonka bean base adds a touch of familiar vanillic tone, but stripped of the typically creamy dessert trappings. This amber glows with the intensity of late summer dusk in the wilderness, satisfyingly sweet but also exhilarating and primal. In other words, exactly what you'd hope for from Rook."," saffron, smoke, incense, amber, maple, black musk, tonka bean and resins",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/859006.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, saffron
Interlude Black Iris Eau de Parfum,Amouage," Inspired by a 1926 close-up painting of an Iris flower by Georgia O'Keeffe, Interlude Black Iris is a deeply seductive and wickedly clever re-imagining of a regal men's classic. Just as with the original Interlude Man, a initially imposing burst of almost majestically powerful frankincense reveals a wondrously harmonious interior life as it develops; but whereas the original Interlude carried the effusive, spice-laden warmth of the baking desert sun, Black Iris is a dispatch from the inky midnight sky, stars illuminating a mouthwatering smorgasbord of rare delights. The intense aromatic oregano and rosemary of the original is toned down here, leaving the opening relatively cool, sparkling, and wet, which in turn unlocks the narcotic smoothness of buttery orris and violet leaf. Richly smoky agarwood and frankincense still carry their royal splendor, but the base leans more towards sandalwood and cedar, creamy and robust. If Interlude Man is a blinding crown of polished jewels, Interlude Black Iris is a flowing, impossibly soft velvet robe- and what king doesn't need both?"," Bergamot, rosemary, violet leaves, orris, amber, frankincense, cistus, myrrh, vanilla, leather, agarwood smoke, patchouli, sandalwood, cedar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/41899.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Escale En Haiti Eau De Cologne,Les Indemodables," Perhaps the most classic of all scents, the ""L'eau de Cologne"" style stays perpetually in fashion because of its wonderful simplicity. Featuring a lighter concentration that puts its emphasis on freshness and wearability, an EDC can actually be an ideal format to showcase exquisite natural materials in high concentrations that might feel overwhelming as part of a richer, more busy perfume. With Escale En Haiti, Les Indemodables transports us to the bustling and beautiful Les Cayes region of Haiti, and their signature crop- vetiver, considered by many to be the best in all the world. Les Cayes vetiver is renowned for its richness and depth- allowed to mature beneath the soil for up to 2 years before harvesting, it develops uniquely bright, sweet citrus tones in addition to the expected earthy and woody properties. And for Escale En Haiti, Les Indemodables uses a 22% concentration of the absolute finest vetiver Les Cayes has to offer: a ""Grand Cru"" distillation hand-selected from unique terroir, carefully root-harvested, and painstakingly distilled at atmospheric pressure, a slower and more expensive process that provides a richer, longer-lasting extract. The results are a stunning natural vetiver cologne with real depth, each ingredient carefully chosen to highlight an element of the extraordinary main ingredient. Electric pink pepper from Reunion Island and aromatic juniper oil from Macedonia bring a spicy, fresh burst, while rich Venezuelan tonka and Somalian myrrh essential oil add a touch of creamy, powdered elegance to the subtle but long-lasting base. Vetiver lovers looking for both freshness and disctinction- this is one you won't want to miss."," Pink pepper, juniper, Haitian vetiver, tonka bean, myrhh",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/827008.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, pink pepper
Escale En Indonesie Eau De Cologne,Les Indemodables," Perhaps the most classic of all scents, the ""L'eau de Cologne"" style stays perpetually in fashion because of its wonderful simplicity. Featuring a lighter concentration that puts its emphasis on freshness and wearability, an EDC can actually be an ideal format to showcase exquisite natural materials in high concentrations that might feel overwhelming as part of a richer, more busy perfume. With Escale En Indonesie, Les Indemodables has chosen to showcase a spectacular specimen of one of the most precious materials in all of perfumery- ambergris. Recovered from the paradise of Sumatra, Indonesia, this top-graded white ambergris was painstakingly distilled into a ""Grand Cru"" tincture, broken down with state-of-the-art ultrasound and then carefully tinctured for over six months to achieve a sublime level of complexity. Every possible facet of this fabled material- vivid ozonic tones, sensual animalics, and electric saltiness- are fully presented, delivering a depth and longevity that are rare for an eau de cologne. And a suite of carefully chosen complementary notes add more EDC freshness- a sunny sparkle of Calabrian bergamot and Sicilian lemon combine with a green, floral freshness from Moroccan neroli oil. Each note teases out even more complexity from the ambergris, which feels as bright and refreshing as the citrus opening but soon gains creamy, seductive tonality from a smooth jasmine and sandalwood base. Don't worry if this sounds a bit heavy for an EDC, as it's delivered with a wonderfully light touch that makes it oh so wearable. But if you've ever wanted a scent that harnessed the true power of ambergris while also maintaining delightful everyday wearability, don't let this hidden gem pass you by."," Bergamot, lemon, neroli, Indonesian ambergris, jasmine, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/827009.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Zeste de Gingembre Eau de Parfum,HEELEY," A mouthwateringly electric cocktail of pure ginger refreshment, Zeste de Gingembre is the best showcase yet of James Heeley's talent for creating sophisticated fresh scents that truly energize and delight. There's nothing over-complicated about the structure here- Zeste opens with, appropriately, an eye-poppingly vivid burst of orange zest, sharp, bright lemon, and crisp, tart lime. The heart of fresh ginger is even more straightforward- a crackling fireball of invigorating, nose-tickling spice with a subtle twist of sweetness that leads into a pink pepper and cardamom base that weaves gourmand, aromatic, clean, and woodsy aspects all together in a lingering and increasingly smooth experience. The best fresh scents from Heeley carry truly unforgettable olfactory signatures- the minty pop of Menthe Fraiche, the salty tang of Sel Marin; the intoxicating burn of Zeste de Gingembre places it firmly in that rarefied company."," Lemon, lime, orange zest, fresh ginger, pink pepper, cardamom",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/31528.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, lemon
Haute Provence Eau de Parfum,Parle Moi de Parfum," The Provence region of France is known for both bucolic beauty- think rolling fields of purple lavender- and also for the glamorous, sun-drenched good life of Riviera enclaves like Saint-Tropez. With Haute Provence, Parle Moi de Parfum delivers a summer-perfect ode to this slice of paradise, a bright, refreshing, seductively smooth lavender scent that's as head-turningly stylish as it is easy to wear. Provencal Lavender is the undeniable star, sharp yet smooth, with a gently aromatic sophistication that places it in an entirely different tier above ordinary, astringent examples of the note. And it meets the perfect complement with a delightfully juicy cocktail of watermelon and green melon, bursting with the sunshine and ocean zest of the Mediterranean coastline. Narcissus adds a bewitching and wild touch of green that lingers stylishly with wonderful floral depth. Summer in Provence is an unforgettable pleasure, and with Haute Provence, you can bring that pleasure with you, anytime and anywhere."," lavender, melon, watermelon, narcissus",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/767015.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, lavender
Smoke Show Eau de Parfum,Vilhelm Parfumerie," The Jazz Soul. Vibrant spotlights, smoky rooms, the brassy notes of a saxophone: an evocative cocktail brings alive the energetic soul of a musical genre that broke boundaries and hearts. Leather and rose take center stage with bass notes of agarwood, vetiver and saffron. What We Think Crisp, energetic, and sexy, this is a fun and frisky leather scent for a night out on the town."," pink pepper, saffron, rose oil, leather, vetiver, cedarwood, agarwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/858000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, pink pepper
Do Not Disturb Eau de Parfum,Vilhelm Parfumerie," Deep in the basement of Studio 54, a place with no boundaries and a Do Not Disturb sign on the door  some say it was never taken off! Rumor has it that Freddy Mercury, David Bowie, Halston, and Grace Jones were spotted here. The only certainty: those who dared to enter found a wonderland! What We Think Freshly musky, spicy, and sparkling, with an unexpected touch of sweetness, Do Not Disturb feels like a dizzy, giddy, possibly illicit romp."," pink pepper, carrot, iris, jasmine petals, ambroxan, patchouli, white musks",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/858001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, pink pepper
Morning Chess Eau de Parfum,Vilhelm Parfumerie," Swedish summers. Bright endless mornings in a cottage, minds battling in wit over a chessboard: the memories of a grandfather's checkmate. The ripe, green lushness of summer on the Swedish coast, where grassy notes are light enough to hint at the evergreen sharpness of the distant winter air. What We Think Fresh, green, and a touch wild- a leather with a comfortably natural streak."," bergamot, Tuscan leather, galbanum, patchouli, black amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/858006.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot

Black Citrus Eau de Parfum,Vilhelm Parfumerie," The triumph of London rain. A sudden shower cooling the air: the romantic smell of London after a rainsquall when water has washed away frivolity, leaving only a zesty and triumphant breeze with a soft echo of the storm. The strength of bergamot, cardamom and violet is tempered by birch tree and a dusting of patchouli. What We Think Spicy, fresh, invigorating citrus with an intriguingly modern profile from the mate and violet heart."," cardamom, calabria bergamot, mate leaves, violet, birch, Indonesian patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/858009.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, cardamom
Lil Fleur Eau de Parfum,BYREDO," With the swirl of emotions that dominate our teenage years- the joys and heartbreaks, the aspirations and fears, it's no wonder that our memories of those heady times will always be among our most intense and indelible. Lil Fleur is a fragrance dedicated to the complexity of adolescence, a lush and beautiful rose scent perched between innocence and sensuality, with all the occasionally bitter sweetness contained therein. At the heart of Lil Fleur is a beautiful Damascena Rose, sparkling, crisp, and tantalizingly sweet. Top notes of cassis and tangerine add to the incandescence, while a smooth, mouthwatering note of saffron glows with the warmth of nostalgia. A romantic and gourmand base is composed of creamy vanilla and a sexy, grown-up touch of blonde, ambered woods, marking Lil Fleur with an unpretentious sophistication that makes it the perfect choice for rose lovers of all ages.

Young Hearts Eau de Parfum,Bruno Acampora," Dewy, fresh, green and peculiar, Young Hearts follows a different rhythm everytime you try it. The opening is woody and green, fresh and very natural with the invigorating notes of bergamot, galbanum, birch and pine. A cold breeze is brought by saffron, which imparts also a leathery impression. The heart elongates the foresty smell of pine with fir balsam, along with a rather abstract floral arrangement. To make it grounded, there is a chypre accord that keeps the beat cool, with a timeless signature."," Bergamot, galbanum, birch leaf, pine, saffron, jasmine, fir balsam, rose, oakmoss, patchouli, musk, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/375041.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Eau de Yuzu Eau de Toilette,PARFUMS DE NICOLAI," An authentic Japanese garden glows with the harmony of natural beauty and expert craftsmanship. It is an all-too-rare demonstration of how human precision and effort can be used to augment nature, rather than replace it, and as a result it achieves a perfection that transcends the division between the manmade and the wild. Eau de Yuzu captures the purity of the morning sun illuminating a sublimely sculpted garden of native Japanese flora, with a vibrantly juicy citrus chord at the center. This is yuzu in all its delectable fullness, with a supplemental note of bright yellow grapefruit only deepening the tart, bright, gently sweet hesperidic character. Aromatic notes of juniper and lemon leaf further increase the naturalistic freshness, while the clean, smooth warmth of gaiac wood evokes the presence of minimal, immaculate woodwork giving form to the garden's edges. And ultimately, a woodsy, earthy patchouli ties everything together, reminding us that the larger world around the garden is still ruled by nature first, and humankind second. Fresh, bright, meditative, and deeply plasurable, Eau de Yuzu is a masterful citrus scent."," Yuzu, lemon leaf, juniper, grapefruit, gaiac, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/313062.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, yuzu

Pas Ce Soir Eau de Parfum,BDK Parfums," Just like every night, Madam is getting ready in her office. She won't have time to go back home. She freshens up, touches her make-up: red velour lipstick, sometimes Bordeaux depending on her mood. She brushes her hair and takes her necklace out from her purse. Her white shirt slightly open highlights her inviting curves. She adds a bit more black to her eyes. She slams the front door as her heels strides on the sidewalk. Just like every Thursdays, she's going to the cabaret Place de la Concorde. Madam has high hopes like every night. She likes people; she loves life. She finds a stool at the bar and orders a whiskey with ice before lighting her cigarette. In the darkness, she makes out a silhouette in front of her. She turns to the side. It's him. It's always him. Their paths often cross but they never speak. She smiles, gets up and goes dancing. Alone. Men line up for her attention, she politely replies. Madam is chic, she responds. Close to 2am, a dandy looking man catches her eyes and invites her to dance. She abides but only for a short period, she leans in says she has to go home. She likes him but the morning is soon approaching. She leaves after whispering these words in his ear...

La Danza delle Libellule Eau de Parfum,Nobile 1942," Since when did Italian fragrance become such a serious endeavor? We have to admit,  we've been feeling a bit lost lately amongst all these challenging,  avant-garde conceptual pieces- every now and again,  don't you just want to wear something unapologetically luxurious? La Danza Delle Libellule (the dance of the dragonflies, ),  a joyously self-assured fruity gourmand,  is the answer to our casual,  indulgent,  dare-we-say-girly? prayers.

Opening with an intensely juicy burst of apple and bergamot,  La Danza immediately distinguishes itself from more straightforward gourmands with its understated approach to sweetness: dry cedar and rich cinnamon give contrast to the bright fruitiness without ever getting sugary or cloying. A pure vanilla,  supported with cocoa and musk,  comforts and pampers to soothe even the most troubled heart. We wear fragrance for plenty of reasons: for love,  for fashion,  for art. This fragrance,  we just want to wear for ourselves."," Bergamot, red apple, cedar, cinnamon, musk, vanilla and coconut.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/52310.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Magnolia Grandiflora - Michel Eau de Parfum,Grandiflora," Michel Roudnitska's expressive, sensuous compositions are few and far between. An accomplished photographer and fervent traveler, he has all but given up commercial perfumery to dedicate himself to other pursuits. But when he met Saskia Havekes, a renowned Australian floral designer, he offered her  and perfume lovers  a priceless gift: the formula of a magnolia fragrance inspired by the magnolia tree in his parents', now his, garden near Grasse. The scent he had worked on for his own pleasure had found a home at Grandiflora.Magnolia Grandiflora Michel is part of a pair of fragrances, both dedicated to Grandiflora's namesake blossom. An unusual debut for a fledgling brand, but a vibrant, emotional tribute to the story behind the scents, since the other magnolia was composed by the late Sandrine Videault, whose mentors were Michel's parents Edmond and ThÃ©rÃ¨se Roudnitska.While Sandrine's magnolia is fresh and shimmering, Michel's interpretation expresses the flower in its full bloom, with its lush waxy petals. As spectacular as a blossom-heavy magnolia tree, with a dark woody undercurrent boosting the heady floral bouquet.

Flamboyant landscapes formed by millions of corals with the most unusual hues. Hibiscus flowers, dancers in straw skirts, a warm breeze on the turquoise sea. The Vanilla of Tahiti softly caresses a tender heart full of flowers. A citrusy and aromatic head of bergamot, lime, sage and rosemary. A flowered heart of jasmine, neroli, mimosa and ylang-ylang and a woody and amber base of patchouly, sandalwood and vetiver."," Bergamot, Key Lime, Sage, Rosemary, Tahitian Vanilla, Jasmine, Neroli, Mimosa, Ylang Ylang, Patchouly, Sandalwood, Vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/440027.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Douleur! Eau de Parfum,Bogue Profumo,"Nail biting sweetness - caramel and candy in metallic wrap. A rose hologram above chewy balsamics sit on a lick of hot skin and wax. DOULEUR! - an oxidized roseDouleur means ""pain, "" which is a seemingly appropriate name for a fragrance created in collaboration with UK tattoo artist and bondage master Freddie Albrighton. But fear not- Douleur understands the intersection of pleasure and pain,  and this uniquely bright,  sweet,  minty metallic rose is as utterly compelling as it is unexpected,  blending modern and gothic influences to feel both wholly Bogue,  and yet also like a departure from Gardoni's typical vintage-influenced animalic florals. Sexy and fresh with a provocative twist,  Douleur is a unforgettable ride."," Mint, cotton candy, seaweed, benzoin, melon, metallic notes, rose",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/66933.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, mint
New York Eau de Parfum,Widian," New York City in the spring may be the most magical place in the world. For once a year, the electric bustle of the city is balanced with delightfully mild temperatures, gentle sunshine, and a fresh breeze that draws even the most cynical citydwellers out into New York's beautiful and far-flung public spaces, now teeming with the energy of new life. This is the inspiration for New York, the latest in Widian's tribute to the great cities, an explosion of bright citrus, spicy florals, and musky woods that positively vibrates with the extraordinary dynamism of the Big Apple. All the energy of a New York spring is present from the very first spray, as New York bursts forth with sun-soaked notes of lemon, bergamot, and mandarin, kissed with a burst of pink pepper. The spicy, aromatic bouquet only grows richer in the romantic heart notes, as striking floral notes of lavender, geranium and rose are combined with coriander and juniper, conjuring a lusciously fresh and deeply sensual tone. And as the smooth, ambered base of tobacco, musk, and never-too-heavy vanilla emerges, you can practically feel the sun setting, and a nighttime of endless possibilities on the horizon. It's just another perfect spring day in the greatest city in the world."," Bergamot, mandarin, lemon, pink pepper, lavender, coriander, juniper, geranium, orris, rose, akigala, jasmine, patchouli, caramel, vetiver, cypriol, white musk, white amber, vanilla, ambergris, olibanum, tonka, tobacco",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/709015.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Gold II Sahara Parfum Extrait,Widian," Like its companion fragrance Gold I, the luminous, captivating Gold II (now presented as Gold II Sahara) is built around the fragrance accord most associated with the precious metal- amber. But while Gold I's amber was powerful and opulent, Sahara is luxuriously smooth, a floral musk with a deep, soft muskiness that evaporates the concerns and trivialities of everyday life in a wondrous cloud of creamy, gently powdery sensuality.On the very first spray of Sahara, a remarkably uplifting opening of bright citrus, rich saffron and spicy elemi invigorates, before the softness of the rose and orange blossom heart steadies the tempo and soothes the soul. In the deep, sweet base, creamy vanillic amber and musky cedarwood relax and seduce. The beauty of gold is its versatility, the ability to dazzle with subtlety as easily as with excess. In Gold II Sahara, Widian chooses that subtle road less traveled, and you're sure to go along for the journey."," Saffron, orange, elemi, rose, orange blossom, amber, musk, cedar, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70906.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, saffron
Midnight Saffron Eau de Parfum,Tom Daxon," Lavender is having a moment, as fragrance houses everywhere are tossing aside its reputation as a sleep-inducing hippie oil, and rediscovering its electric sensuality. Midnight Saffron, born of Tom Daxon's long standing love for lavender, takes this energy and runs wild with it, mixing up a potent cocktail of spicy woods to create a vibrantly sexy scent that will carry you into the wee hours. As the name would suggest, the central spice involved is saffron, which here is stripped of its more foody elements to reveal the raw, crackling carnality underneath- which, in turn, amps up the animalic energy of the exquisite lavender note, created from a mixture of France and Bulgaria's finest lavender oils and absolutes. As Midnight Saffron dries, a smoothly woodsy leather note enhances and refines, but the energy never dips, even in the drydown. As we mentioned at the top, Midnight Saffron is a different take on lavender- one that's ready to stay up just as late as you are."," Saffron, lavender, jasmine, suede, amber woods",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/62631.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, saffron
Opale Eau de Parfum,Omnia Profumo," Truly a breath of fresh air, Opale is a gem of a marine floral that evokes the sun-drenched gardens and sparkling waters of the Mediterranean coast. From the very first spritz, a symphony of gentle florals flits through the air, combining the soft purity of jasmine and lilac with delicately spicy and earthy notes of hawthorne and geranium. But the core of the scent is an oh-so-oceanside note of fresh, salty, ozonic seaweed that wraps around a smooth and lively white musk to create a pitch-perfect image of a relaxing coastal breeze, which lingers for hours thanks to touches of woodsy and gourmand notes to accentuate and enrich the authentically oceanic tang. Carefree, lively, and joyful, Opale is an aquatic scent for the romantic in us all."," Jasmine, lilac, hawthorne, geranium, seaweed, white musk, patchouli, cedar, vanilla, tonka",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/46111.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, jasmine
Single Man Eau de Parfum,Moth and Rabbit," It is the gay man that got me curious, troubled by ordinary grief and haunted by joy, a man apart and yet like any other; Followed by numbness, routine, sorrow and perhaps another kind of awakening. It is a fragrance based on a variety of woody notes such as violet wood, cashmere wood, mahogany and cedar wood; that reflects the man who constructs or reconstructs a personality to bear the weight of loss, and whom society will not permit to grieve.  MARK BUXTON, perfumer What We Think Humming with restrained intensity, Single Man features a rich accord of dry, resinous woods and dark spice, freshened slightly with a semisweet, oily citrus note. It's a quietly powerful scent for those who don't want to fill the room but still want to make a statement."," Cardamom, Ginger Oil, Red Pepper, Winter Lemon Oil, Nutmeg, Rose, Elemi Oil, Violet Wood, Cashmere Wood, Oakmoss, Amber, Patchouli, Mahogany, Cedar.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/666009.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, cardamom
Limited 71 Intense Eau de Parfum,Widian," Named for the 1971, the year that the United Arab Emirates declared their independence and sovereignty, Limited 71 is a lavishly celebratory new release from the house of Widian. Balancing an opening wave of fresh citrus and sweet spice against a smooth, enchanting heart of smoky woods, ambergris and patchouli, Limited 71 excites and hypnotizes in equal measure.

Manteuse Eau de Parfum,Stephane Humbert Lucas 777," A play on words combining the deadly praying mantis with the french word for ""deceiver, "" Manteuse is quite clearly not meant to be a gentle fragrance. Instead,  this bold new floral from Stephane Humbert Lucas is a swaggering,  sensuous throwback to the unapologetic musky florals of the 1990s,  strong,  warm,  and utterly mesmerizing. Opening with a rich,  vivid blast of bergamot and bright white florals,  Manteuse stuns its prey before injecting its poison,  a deeply narcotic,  languorous blend of sweet honey and rich,  resin-flushed iris. As the deeply powdery,  smoothly seductive base of woodsy musks takes hold,  we find ourselves utterly paralyzed,  gripped with uncontrollable pleasure,  defenseless against the gorgeous power of the scent. For those who still long for bold,  sexy fragrances meant to unapologetically turn heads,  Manteuse is bound to be your newest obsession."," Bergamot, white flowers, leather, honey, iris, labdanum, sandalwood, smoked vanilla, shangrilade musk, oppoponax",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/655015.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Against Nature Eau de Parfum,Timothy Han Edition Perfumes," Inspired by Joris-Karl Huysmans' 1884 novel of the same name which broke from his naturalist roots, this is a decadent re-interpretation of nature at its most ornate, along with an undercurrent of unmistakably human components. Like the journey of Huysmans' protagonist, who isolated himself from earth in order to re-build himself outside of conventional society, the scent is both primal and intellectual, compelling and disturbing, untethered and utterly unapologetic. Intense notes of lush leafy green foliage, moist soil & earthy mosses merge with with notes of cold metal, blood and lacquer, invoking a wildly unique atmosphere somewhere between the primordial world and the flawed, brilliant human soul. Vivid and intriguing, this is most certainly not a scent for everyone- something Huysmans would most certainly approve of."," Pink pepper, lemon, juniper, green notes, metal, jasmine, ylang ylang, lacquer, musk, vetiver, sandalwood, amber, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/69403.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, pink pepper
Kiviskin Eau de Parfum,Piotr Czarnecki," Inspired by the beauty of luxury leather goods, Kiviskin is a bracingly fresh, invigoratingly natural-feeling scent, painting a bold portrait of spice, tobacco and suede. A richly tingling blend of saffron, nutmeg and pimento opens with vibrant energy and airy brightness, leading into a fresh, wild tobacco note with ample tonalities of spicy green, as if the plant is still firmly rooted in the field. As the leather emerges, buttressed with unsweetened dark chocolate and resinous benzoin, the result is a leather fragrance with unquestionable depth but dynamic natural freshness, and a interpretation of leather we're pleased to say we've never before experienced. Authentically deep, intriguingly modern, Kiviskin is a leather that only Piotr Czarnecki could give us."," Saffron, nutmeg, pimento, violet, tobacco, dark chocolate, benzoin, cedar, leather",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/66003.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, saffron
Hili Eau de Parfum,Widian," A lush flower garden surrounding extraordinarily preserved structures and sites dating back to the Bronze Age, the Hili Archaeological Park and Gardens is one of the true treasures of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi. Drawing inspiration from the magical location, Hili, the latest from Widian's Velvet Collection, is a stunning floral oriental that captures the delicate beauty of the gardens and the intriguing mysteries of the historic site in one compelling fragrance.Hili opens with a vibrantly colorful burst of bergamot and pink pepper, laced with a balanced strain of coriander and cinnamon. The floral heart, the true star of the show, blooms with delicate lushness, the jasmine and tuberose soft and non-indolic, the ylang and tiare sweet and gently powdered, all atop a base of smooth woods and a distinctively creamy coconut milk that the ethereally smooth florals sink into with seamless grace. All told, it perfectly represents the gardens it models itself on: a work of dreamlike beauty, expertly engineered to seem effortless."," Bergamot, pink pepper, coriander, cinnamon, jasmine, tuberose, ylang ylang, tiare, amber, vanilla, coconut milk, sandalwood, patchouli, cedar, tobacco leaf",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70913.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
London Eau de Parfum,Widian," The Sapphire Collection, a new collection by Widian, formerly AJ Arabia, is the perfect fusion of East meets West. The East: Widian, an Arabian niche perfume firm inspired by the architecture of Sheikh Zayed's Grand Mosque and the modern Arab spirit in the city of Abu Dhabi. The West: the glittering cityscapes of the grandest Western cities, such as London, Paris, and New York. Traditional Arabic perfumery meets Western abstraction; a perfect fusion of the old and the new, the traditional and the contemporary, and yes, East and West. London is Widian's first entry in the Sapphire Collection, and it nails the East-meets-West theme with aplomb. On the surface, a juicy raspberry and delicate floral petals are flanked by a lush cypress and leather accord. But the smoky, moody darkness of agarwood from the jungles of the Far East sweeps shadows underneath the freshness of this scene, tugging us away from London and towards the East. Its exotic mystery is deepened further by amber and musk that lends the scent a radiantly dry, sandy texture, turning our gaze to the red-gold desserts of the Arabian Peninsula.  Simultaneously reassuring and exciting, this fragrance is a fitting tribute to London, and the perfect vehicle to show what happens when Eastern exoticism meets Western polish. London truly is a winning proposition."," Oud, cypress, violet, lily of the valley, raspberry, leather, dry amber, musk, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70912.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, oud
Grimoire Eau de Parfum,Anatole Lebreton," A Grimoire: an ancient word for an ancient tome of spells, a sacred text, powerful in the right hands and dangerous in the wrong ones. Anatole Lebreton invites us to imagine such a volume, weathered by age and coated in dust, at the center of an overgrown cabin, invisible to all but the trained eye. An open window lets just the faintest sliver of light inside, along with the scents of green moss climbing the walls and a well-cultivated garden of herbs and spices, essential for the creation of magical objects. Dense clouds of incense dance in the light-beam, hinting at secrets unknowable, power as-of-yet untapped, waiting in a realm directly above and below our own. Warm, rich woods from the cabin walls and dusty paper from the pages of the book give rich body to the unique aroma inside, comforting but imposing, like a warm embrace you might never emerge from. An incense fragrance well beyond the confines of the modern world."," Bergamot, basil, lavender, elemi, olibanum, Atlas cedar, cumin, patchouli, moss, muscs",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70804.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
The Decay Of The Angel Eau de Parfum,Timothy Han Edition Perfumes," This is a memorizing, burnt bouquet of exotic flowers inspired by Yukio Mishima's 1971 posthumously published novel, The Decay of The Angel. Like all of Timothy Han's creations, the highest level of natural ingredients are used here, and Han's artistic vision presents a smart,  deeply affecting fragrance that walks us through the 5 stages of a falling angel: decay, diaphoresis, dirt, dissatisfaction, and ultimately, darkness.Han's olfactive interpretation of an angelic fall starts with mandarin doused rose, ylang, and neroli. The fresh opening is contrasted with a heart of indolic jasmine, ripe and just starting to wilt. Its gloriously smoky base includes crisp frankincense along with smoldering cade, oud and cedar woods.Â  Patchouli, tonka and labdanum add a dimension of soft earthiness.A sensual intermingling of hedione and musk float throughout the charred dry-down, contrasting heavenly veneration and human desires. Dazzling, challenging, and alluring, The Decay of The Angel makes a strong argument for the sensual perks of mortality."," Mandarin, neroli, rose, ylang-ylang, frankincense, sambac jasmine, acacia, cade, oud, cedarwood, patchouli, tonka, labdanum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/69402.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, mandarin
L'homme Accompli Eau de Parfum,Divine," Yann Vasnier has done it again. A fresh, bone-dry masculine leather, L'Homme Accompli exudes quiet class from every pore. Opening on the classic snap of a Farina-style eau de cologne, the bristle of herbs and lemon soon dies back to reveal a musky, violet leaf-driven leather that will bring tears to the eyes of the vintage Fahrenheit lover. It is at once a familiar and elegant smell  signature scent worthy for the man who is sure of his place in the world. Bolstered by a musky Atlas cedar, L'Homme Accompli's leather accord has tremendous body and presence, while managing to skip all the sweet, gouty richness of modern masculine leathers. And it's that lightness of touch that makes this fragrance so special - the air and space that Vasnier has injected into its structure allows room to breathe. L'Homme Accompli grows ever drier and darker as time passes, the herbs and violet leather curling up under the smoke of styrax resin and guaiac wood, and finishing in a salty whisper of beach amber. If Cary Grant were a fragrance, he would be L'Homme Accompli."," Amber, leather, vetiver, guaiac wood, styrax, atlas cedar, violet, lemon, bergamot",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/22716.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, amber
White Madera Eau de Parfum,Omnia Profumo," For years now, Omnia's Madera has been one of our reference gourmand scents- a sumptuous, mouthwatering butterscotch-vanilla-caramel delight that turns heads and entices those in its trail. Now, Omnia returns to one of their greatest hits with a fresh new take, supplementing the warm sweetness we love with a crisp, fresh, spicy new heart that ignites the senses and reinvents a classic. While the fragrance still opens with the instantly recognizable, positively sumptuous mix of vanilla bean and rich Madagascar vanilla, now it's also lightened and brightened with juicy, tart citrus. In the heart, the difference becomes even more clear, as licorice-y star anise and fiery cinnamon bring an intense, bright, and subtly masculine edge, while the soft florals of the original Madera still blend with the vanilla to provide smooth creaminess. And in the impossibly rich base, coconut and musk still join the party, keeping us firmly in gourmand territory. So is White Madera still Madera? Absolutely- the cozy, delectable vanilla you know and love is still very much present. But this is a new Madera, with a spicy, sophisticated, grown-up kick- and those seeking some energy with their comfort will not be disappointed."," Vanilla, citrus, peach blossom, floral notes, cinnamon, star anise, tobacco blossom, coconut, white musk, cedar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/46110.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, vanilla
Quilombo Eau de Parfum,Fueguia 1833," In colonial Brazil, Quilombos were synonymous of resistance and independence. Protected by a labyrinth of rivers and impenetrable forests, these fugitive worlds encapsulated an untouched tropical landscape. Mixing together native and African roots, a wild atmosphere emerged full of dances, rhythms and delicious flavours made from cupuacÃº and dulce de leche (a candied concentration made from burnt milk).  This is the scent of Quilombo, a mouthwatering treat that elevates the art of the milky gourmand beyond where we thought it could go. A sweet, creamy, ""how did they do that?""-level realistic hot milk accord wows our noses and tastebuds alike, while careful touches of vanilla and cane sugar supplement without overwhelming, keeping the composition specific and never in the realm of generic dessert scent. Long a symbol of hope, perseverance and joy in the face of oppression, Quilombos occupy an important place in Brazilian history. No matter your own personal battles, we think Quilombo can be a fragrance that offers some small element of these important concepts with each spray."," Vanilla, Pampa Milk, Cane Sugar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/62134.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, vanilla
La Cautiva Eau de Parfum,Fueguia 1833," A heavenly musk laced with fruit and vanilla. La Cautiva meansThe Captive,  and it refers to an epic poem by Esteban Echeverria which is considered one of the first great works of modern Argentinian literature. This is an imaginative speculation about the scent of Mary, the main character, and while we have never read the poem, we can state unequivocally that she smelled delicious. This is airy and delectable  an enchanting confection that features a creamy whipped vanilla and a piercingly sweet black currant. The musk is soft spoken and warms to the skin as the edible elements come forward. Initially, there is a hint of syrup to the berries, but the intense sugar eases into a juicy, fresh currant with a hint of minty green leaves. As cloud-light and effortless as a meringue, topped with perfectly ripe berries - this is like a dessert you would eat in a dream.  The perfect warm weather gourmand."," Musk, blackcurrant, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/62106.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, musk
Panthea Eau de Parfum,Stephane Humbert Lucas 777," How do you picture the scent of heaven? Forget about the specificity of religion, and focus only on the general concept: a pearly-white paradise above the clouds, clean and enveloping, mysterious yet sublimely blissful. This is the scent of Panthea, a fresh, feminine, iris-driven addition to the 777 series imbued with an almost transcendent sense of grace. Pathea opens with an energetic sense of freshness, balancing the gentle juiciness of tangerine against the sparkle of pink pepper with a sweepingly smooth white tea providing a pristine backdrop. The heart of iris has plenty of compelling powdery floral character, but also a softness that eschews rooty or earthy tones in favor of delightfully lush white florals and muskiness. A delicate balance of light woods, tonka and patchouli lend longevity without bulk- the scent is weightless throughout. Spend a day in the clouds with Panthea- we doubt you'll ever want to come back to earth."," Bergamot, pink pepper, tangerine, elemi, white tea, carrot, iris, jasmine, violet, carnation, white musk, tobacco flower, tonka, sandalwood, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/65513.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
MEM Eau de Parfum,Bogue Profumo," Not since AimÃ¨ Guerlain created Jicky in 1889 has a perfumer done something so radical to lavender. Antonio Gardoni takes the sunny herb from its kitchen garden setting and passes it through clay, wood, minerals, burned sugar, and wax so that a new form emerges, like steel forged by the elements. MEM contains all the hallmark Bogue signatures but represents a clear step forward in complexity even from the masterpiece that is Maai.MEM opens up on a dark lavender note that smells less like fresh herbs and more like clay and cepes. Sunshine soon arrives in the form of hops, toasted malt, and the pale ale fizz of aldehydes, lifting the scent out of its humus-rich opening. The scorched-sugar of ethyl maltol caramelizes the lavender, creating a phantom accord of fruit like the dark, almost calcified contents of a forgotten jar of peach marmalade. But as soon as the mind adjusts to this accord, MEM shifts again, this time into a rich floral heart of jasmine, rose, and ylang ylang that sacrifices prettiness for the more interesting facets of wax, gasoline, and rubber. Indian sandalwood with its wheaten milkiness and Himalayan cedarwood with its lingering note of woodsmoke work in tandem to ease the florals and aromatics into the base. The drydown, which is sturdy and beautiful, weaves the sweet dust of unlit incense into the musky, salty, animalic base of a barbershop fougere. MEM is not a perfume that lends itself to easy interpretation, it will reward your patience a hundred times over. In terms of who can wear it, MEM is something of a chimera: sometimes it seems masculine, at others, feminine. Beautiful, quixotic, and memorable, we think this is artisanal perfumery at its most daring."," Petitgrain, mandarin, grapefruit, lavender (4 different species), ylang ylang, lily of the valley, white champaca, jasmine grandiflorum, rose damascena, bourbon geranium, vanilla, peppermint, laurel, Siam benzoin, rosewood, sandalwood, Himalayan cedarwood, labdanum, ambergris, musk, castoreum, civet, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/66921.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, petitgrain
Delma Eau de Parfum,Widian," The Dalma Island lies just off the coast of Abu Dhabi.  It's known for its pearl trade and famous for its pearl divers and legends of buried treasure left behind by ""pearl pirates.""     Widian uses the images and stories of Dalma Island as inspiration for one of its softest, sweetest compositions yet. Leather and marshmallow shape a base that is as delicious as it is fresh. It creates the foundation for Delma's creaminess, which never crosses fully into the gourmand category,  but rather is contrasted by resinous guaiac and fresh green galbanum. The peach-laced floral heart of the composition is balanced by a dusting of saffron and nutmeg. Delma's contrasting notes are masterfully blended into the olfactive equivalent of the smooth, iridescent texture of a pearl.  Shimmering, sweet and irresistible."," Mandarin, peach, bergamot, heliotrope, jasmine, freesia, geranium, nutmeg, patchouli, saffron, leather, woody notes, marshmallow",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70909.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, mandarin
Liwa Eau de Parfum,Widian," The Liwa oasis is a lush valley of date palm farms and Bedouin villages in the middle of a seemingly endless sea of sand. Its improbable beauty is the inspiration behind Widian's newest fragrance, a gorgeously modern oriental that perfectly blends stylish florals with exotic spice. Liwa evokes the oasis with lush jasmine, creamy amber, and sandalwood surrounded by dry saffron, wafting smoke and a powdery patchouli and vetiver base. It's a perfectly balanced combination of heady powdery spice and smoke with creamy sweet white florals and ambers. Like its namesake, Liwa is a hidden treasure, waiting to be discovered."," Jasmine, saffron, bergamot, artemisia, amber, white rose, geranium, cedar, patchouli, sandalwood, incense",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70910.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, jasmine
Aqaysos Eau de Parfum,Pierre Guillaume Paris Black Collection," What is the scent of crystalline wood? This concept,  of the strange geometry that might exist somewhere between nature's most versatile material and one of it's most fascinatingly exact,  is what inspired Pierre Guillaume to create Aqaysos,  a scent which casts a fascinatingly illusive prism that alternates between spicy,  fruity and woody notes. The result is an elusive,  versatile and sneakily powerful fragrance that wears like a suave,  modern,  and refreshing take on a certain wildly popular fruit-inflected masculine. Which isn't to say Aqaysos is another dull Aventus knockoff. In fact,  quite the opposite- while the juicy,  explosively fresh lime and bergamot opening is sure to delight,  it's cut with an aromatic dose of coriander,  lending a metallic quality to it,  at once mathematically precise and yet intriguingly otherworldly. A unique heart of little-used sansho berry,  with its lemon-peppery spiciness,  adds fiery depth to the sweet,  juicy blackcurrant. And growing ever stronger as it dries,  a robustly woodsy and musky base is given subtly bitter power with a dose of cocoa bean,  which asserts itself in unexpected rhythms. Lovers of fresh,  fruit-and-wood driven masculine scents will surely find a new go-to with Aqaysos. But this fascinatingly complex crystal palace hides secrets all its own.A first for the Huitieme Art collection,  Aqaysos is presented in a unique ""Shadow Flacon, "" with the iconic Parfumerie Generale silhouette blacked out by an interior ceramic coating."," Lime, coriander, blackcurrant, sansho berry, woods, musks, cocoa beans",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/54516.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, lime
Carnicure (formerly L'animal sauvage) Eau de Parfum,Marlou," Wow. Carnicure is one naughty little kitty. In case you've been looking for it, Carnicure is the sweet spot between the ferocious dirtiness of Serge Lutens Muscs Kublai Khan, the smutty florals of Kiehl's, and the milky innocence of Helmut Lang EDP. In other words, this one is not only gorgeous, not only elegant, but above all exceedingly sexy.A brief flash of flowers - orange blossom and violet  set the mood for passion, and before we know it we're lying on a massive bed piled high with animal pelts in front of an open fire in an ancient castle. The deep, civety funk of the fur mingles with the smells of desire- salt, sweat, skin, and human fur. But an echo of the sugared flower petals and milky sandalwood still glows through the haze of musk, gently suggestive of the comfort of a lovers' bathing ritual. Innocence lost, and then regained  over and over again. This right here is the smell of human intimacy.Update: Carnicure is a new and improved version of the L'animal sauvage, slightly reworked to deliver a newly focused base that incorporates touches of vanilla, sandalwood, ambergris, and labdanum. It's slightly less fruity than the original, but its deeply sensual spirit is unchanged."," Orange blossom, violet, sandalwood, patchouli, civet, vanilla, sandalwood, musk, ambergris, labdanum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76300.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, orange blossom
Passion Eau de Parfum,M. Micallef," In the throes of true passion, there is no room for hesitation, self-consciousness or restraint- only inspiration. M. Micallef's newest creation is a true representation of that fervor, a vivid sensory rush of juicy fruits, fiery spices and deep, rich woods that combines for a euphoric, luxurious fragrance experience unlike any other. Bold, mouthwatering orange washes over a smooth, caramel-inflected oud with spikes of cinnamon and deep, gourmand patchouli, creating a vibrant and romantic ode to love and artistry. The brilliant, eye-catching gold bottle only increases the compelling sensuality, promising that Passion will be the centrepiece of any collection. Give yourself over to Passion- we're certain you'll come away more than satisfied."," Orange, cinnamon, cashmeran, caramel, benzoin, sandalwood, musk, patchouli, oud",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/24554.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, orange
Oud Noir Intense Eau de Parfum,Fragrance du Bois," Unlike the majority of orientals calledintense ornoir, Oud Noir Intense actually lives up to its name. Weaving jasmine and roses into a brocade of pure, smoky oud, sandalwood, musk, and spices, the result is an incredibly rich, potent perfume that feels like it should be kept in a ceremonial chamber for anointing the temples and robes of Emirati royals. The fragrance is complex but so expertly blended that each note feels like an extension of the next: spicy florals, creamy musks, animalic oud oil, smoky-sweet resins, and earthy patchouli all swirled together like cream through a cup of black coffee. A dark and mesmerizing fragrance that represents the very pinnacle of oriental and Arabic perfumery."," bergamot, cardamom, rose, jasmine, sandalwood, saffron, patchouli, vanilla, musk, amber, pure agarwood (oud)",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/75703.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Sahraa Oud Eau de Parfum,Fragrance du Bois," Despite its desert inspiration, Sahraa Oud is a perfume that is as placidly, richly golden as a piece of Bvlgari costume jewelry. Featuring a large dollop of the real oud oil that Fragrance du Bois sources directly from its plantations in Asia, its soft but feral aroma is cushioned by layers of sweet, orangey amber, sandalwood, and roses  essentially a dab of oud buried deep within the folds of Fendi's Theorema.  Warm, soft, and almost waxy in its roundness, this is a scent that gives off the satiny glow of an aged wine. A touch of inky moss and spicy saffron lends Sahraa Oud a chypre touch, giving the waxy amber a faintly bitter, pleasing bite, like the patina on old wood. Rather than the desert, Sahraa Oud brings us to a backstreet in Tokyo, its velvety darkness lit by strings of glowing red and orange lanterns."," rose, geranium, jasmine, moss, patchouli, sandalwood, saffron, vanilla, amber, pure oud",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/75704.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, rose
London Oud Eau de Parfum,Fragrance du Bois," Too good not to share! That's what former World Heavyweight Boxing Champion David Haye, said to Fragrance du Bois when they handed him this originally bespoke fragrance. So they unleashed it on the world, and boy, are we glad. Composed to reflect the exciting mix of cultures and stories of the city Haye loves, London Oud is a true melting pot of a fragrance that pulls together opposing elements that you'd think won't work together but absolutely do. The aromatic freshness of spearmint, lemon, and lavender adds lift and movement to the spicy, dark woodiness of the oud oil, and the whole thing is shot through with sparkling marine notes. An aquatic oud fragrance? An unusual approach but we find this fragrance utterly convincing  it's a great marriage of land (oud) and sea (aquatics) that proves that diversity truly is the spice of life."," lemon, bergamot, mint, lavender, jasmine, white flowers, marine notes, patchouli, cedar, nutmeg, cardamom, pure agarwood (oud)",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/75705.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, lemon
Oud Bleu Intense Eau de Parfum,Fragrance du Bois," Oud Bleue Intense does indeed have a strangelyblue vibe to it. Bracing and intense, its mixture of marine air, earth, truffles, and ozone is simply intoxicating. Opening with an earthy, fungal myrrh fused with oily sandalwood, the scent picks up spice in the form of nutmeg and cardamom but retains that cool tone. A bright mandarin note weaves it way through the resins and spices, keeping things as fresh as a Mediterranean breeze. The citrus, myrrh, and spices continue to dominate well into the heart, where they merge smoothly with a rich, balsamic amber. In what has become a signature of Fragrance du Bois, the pure oud oil in this composition is deployed as a unifying balm to knit all the other elements together rather than to stand out on its own. If you're wary of oud but love fresh, spicy, balsamic ambers, then give this one a try. It's superb."," Cardamom, nutmeg, mandarin, frankincense, labdanum, myrrh oil, amber, pure oud oil, sweet myrrh, styrax, benzoin, myrrh resin",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/75707.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, cardamom
Oud Rouge Intense Eau de Parfum,Fragrance du Bois," There is something incredibly sexy about Oud Rouge Intense. At first glance, the notes seem minimalistic. But put it on warm skin and it comes alive, the bright, spicy pepper and lemon mingling with the musky cedar and dry, aromatic sandalwood to create a scent that will leave people wondering if you're wearing perfume or if your skin just smells that amazing. Imagine making love in the middle of a forest, your skin, sweat, and hair mingling with the soil, wood dust, and ion-charged air, and that's what this smells like. The woods play off each other in a subtly exciting way: the musky, slight bitter cedar adding muscle, the sandalwood a lactic creaminess, and the pure oud oil a smoky, medicinal depth that feels as old as time itself. Lovers of aromatic, spicy woods  your ship has come in."," Pink pepper, lemon, cedar, patchouli, sandalwood, oud",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/75700.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, pink pepper
Verde di Persia Parfum Concentration,Farmacia SS. Annunziata dal 1561," Mouthwateringly sweet, vibrantly warm, Verde di Persia is a blast of summer air with enough zest and energy to heat up even the chilliest fall or winter day. Delectably juicy cassis and green apple combine with bracingly green davana and sweet, creamy osmanthus and pistachio flower for a naturally fruit-laden delight, while amber, musk and patchouli bring a dry and intense breeze reminiscent of the height of summertime, compellingly intense and evocative. It's a divine escape, one we're delighted to find works perfectly in every temperature, a scent that brings summertime vibes all year around. A true delight through and through, Verde di Persia is the kind of climate change we can get behind."," Orange, lemon, cassis, green apple, davana, pistachio flower, rose, apricot, osmanthus, patchouli, rosewood, amber woods, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/44025.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, orange
20 Years Eau de Parfum,M. Micallef," Twenty years ago, Martine Micallef, Geoffrey Nejman and Jean Claude Astier introduced a brand that would set the high standard for how luxury niche fragrance should look, feel, present and smell. Now, as they celebrate their 20th anniversary, M. Micallef has released a new Les Exclusifs scent inspired by a renewed drive for travel and exploration, a modern gourmand that borrows expertly from M. Micallef's rich history of elegant florals and mouthwatering gourmands, while also incorporating the sophisticated and spicy exoticism that has shown up in their more recent work. The result is a fragrance that sums up the best of what this iconic brand has to offer, while also proving that the wondrous creativity of this team is as fresh as ever.20 Years opens with precious notes of white rose and transparent jasmine, fresh, lush and romantic, which reveal subtly sweet and herbaceous davana and rich, gorgeous orange blossom. Micallef's signature gourmand touch soon sweeps us away on a tide of delectable caramel, faceted with earthy-sweet patchouli and precious woods, buffered with impossibly creamy vanilla. As lusciously beautiful as the scent is the bottle, which adds a new element to the famous Les Exclusifs design with a subtly reptile-inspired outer cover that evokes change and transformation. Warm, sensual, elegant and complex, 20 Years is a celebration of all that M. Micallef has accomplished, and a sign that the next few decades are more promising still."," Bergamot, nutmeg, exotic fruit, white rose, davana, orange flower, jasmine, geranium, patchouli, caramel, vanilla, precious wood, white musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/24552.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Queen Of The Night Eau de Parfum,Grandiflora," With unique insight Bertrand Duchaufour has thrown a noose The Selenicereus Grandiflorus, or Queen of the Night, is a rare cactus with a dramatic feature- it blooms but once a year, for a single night, with a fragrance so uniquely beautiful that it has been the stuff of legend for centuries. With this inspiration, Bertrand Duchaufour and Grandiflora have delivered a fragrance that not only captures the devastating beauty of this remarkable plant, but also the poetically fluid nature of its transformation, a captivating mix of memory and desire. Impossible to unravel, the floral bouquet opens fresh, bright and lightly fruity, gaining lushness and vibrancy by the moment before dawn's light sees the florals slowly recede into a gentle base with delicate woodsy and powdery tones. As with the fleeting bloom it so perfectly represents, Queen of the Night is sensual, compelling and evocatively bittersweet- a tale of love without regret."," Citrus, berries, clove, orange blossom, jasmine sambac, ylang ylang, tuberose, gardenia, pittosporum, wisteria, mimosa, vanilla, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64203.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, citrus
Taklamakan Eau de Parfum,Stephane Humbert Lucas 777," Dark and sultry, dry and sweet, Taklamakan ripples like the sands of the desert for which it was named, engulfing you in an addictive cloud of smoky vanilla, luxurious caramel, richly spiced patchouli, and sumptuously balsamic resins under skies heavy with ambergris. Hot, dry desert winds blow from the east, bringing exotic luxuries from the ancient Spice Route, incense and opoponax, and setting ablaze a rich cadre of woods consisting of Chinese cedar, birch, cade, and guaiac. As they slowly envelop the dark vanilla at Taklamakan's heart, dusty myrrh and sweet myrrh cast their magic in a haunting spell that is made all the richer by opulent sandalwood, luxuriously creamy tonka, chewy labdanum, and a drop of dry rose. In its drydown, Taklamakan becomes a comforting dream of golden amber infused with creamy plushness, dry woods, velvety resins, and soft spiciness. Powerful, deep, and long-lasting, Taklamakan entranced us with its sweet desert song, and has become a new favorite from Stephane Humbert Lucas."," Bergamot, rose, patchouli coeur, black vanilla, tonka absolute, birch, cade, gaiac, cedar, myrrh, orris, tolu balsam, labdanum, ambreine, amber gris, benzoin, sandalwood, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/65512.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Perdizione Eau de Parfum,Nobile 1942," Being lost isn't necessarily a bad thing. Sometimes it's liberating to completely let yourself go, to give in utterly to pleasure and let the tides of delight carry you where they will. That's exactly what Nobile 1942 had in mind when they created Perdizione, a lusciously rich tempest of sweet florals whipped up in a compellingly smooth, creamy layer of musks and woods that makes our heads spin and our mouths water. Bright and sensual neroli and sweet ylang blend with elegant jasmine, while a creamy vanilla sweeps in like a monsoon and envelops everything in a blissful haze where down is up and time and space lose meaning. We may not know where we're going once we're lost in Perdizione. But we're in no rush to find out."," Grapefruit, bergamot, lavender, ylang-ylang, rose, orange blossom, neroli petitgrain, cedar, vanilla, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/52317.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, grapefruit
Sandalo Nobile Eau de Parfum,Nobile 1942," We've always loved Nobile 1942, but the venerable Italian house has been on a particular tear lately, releasing a series of inspired scents that pull off the impressive feat of being as wearable as they are strikingly original. So when we say that Sandalo Nobile is as comfortable and easy to wear as any sandalwood in recent memory, that's not faint praise- spicy yet smooth, robustly textured yet soft-spoken, Sandalo Nobile is a deliciously woodsy treat for the senses. Think of it as a just-stronger-than-skin scent that even the manliest of men could wear with confidence. Sandalo Nobile opens with a rich tapestry of spices, where fiery cumin and mouthwatering saffron open the palate to a buttery iris that seals in the near-gourmand elements just in time for the woods to emerge. And what a blend of woods it is- lightly green fig tree, peppery gurjum, fresh cedar, and the star of the show, a sandalwood both creamy and robust, velvety smooth, and humming with quiet power. Looking for an everyday sandalwood scent that doesn't believe that discretion is the opposite of personality? Nobile 1942 has just what you need."," Saffron, cumin seed, iris, fig wood, gurjum, sandalwood, benzoin, white musk, cedar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/52316.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, saffron
Black V Parfum Extrait,Widian," Bold yet sophisticated, luscious yet playful, Black V is a snappy, vivacious, and utterly lovely floral-driven parfum extrait that recalls the verve, vigor and creativity of the 1920's. Black V opens with a blast of energy, combining spicy cinnamon with crisp, tart lemon peel and juicy peach. In the sumptuous heart of the fragrance, narcotic tuberose is given a natural vibrancy with lightly bitter orange blossom and a bright solar accord, leading into a rich but never heavy base of warm cedar, smooth vanilla, and a dollop of sweet caramel. All of Widian's wondrous fragrances combine the best of east and west; we're thrilled to report that Black V also includes a tantalizing, joyful mix of past and present."," Lemon, peach, cinnamon, tuberose, orange blossom, solar accord, cedar, caramel, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70904.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, lemon
La Danza delle Libellule Exceptional Edition Parfum Extrait,Nobile 1942," Since we added La Danza delle Libellule to our store last year, we've been overwhelmed with the response- it turns out a lot of people out there are just as swept away as we are by its gorgeous, whimsically feminine combination of sweet fruits, creamy vanilla and playful spices. In fact, just like many others, we've loved La Danza so much that we find ourselves wanting more. Which is why we're so pleased to announce the Exceptional Edition, a sumptuous Parfum Extrait that captures everything we love about the original Eau de Parfum in a gorgeously rich 35% concentration. Now, the red apple is juicier and sweeter, the cinnamon spicier, the vanilla warmer, creamier and butterier, all with a sillage and longevity that last for countless wondrous hours. When we reviewed the original La Danza, we called it the kind of fragrance that you'd wear just to treat yourself. With the Exceptional Edition, that treat just got all the more delightfully indulgent."," Bergamot, red apple, cedar, cinnamon, musk, vanilla, coconut",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/52314.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Salome Eau de Parfum,Papillon Artisan Perfumes," Close the blinds and send the kids to bed- Salome, the latest sensation from Papillon Artisan Perfumes, is Sexy with a grown-up, capital ""S""-- a swooningly vintage-feeling delight that proves that the golden era of full-bodied perfumery isn't nearly as bygone as the doubters might claim. Built around a strikingly animalic blend of rich, dirty florals and even dirtier animalics, Salome is put together with such deft, classic skill that we'd be praising its refinement- that is, if we weren't busy picking our jaws up off the floor. Just as the biblical Salome had a seven-veiled dance of progressive seduction, so too does Salome seduce in tantalizing layers. At first spray, we're struck with bright, bitter orange blossom and the sweet richness of rose and jasmine, with the indolic sensuality of the florals growing gradually. As the rich heart of animalics begins to growl, suggestiveness turns to an all-out bacchanal, with hyraceum, castoreum and an increasingly indolic jasmine all adding their own elements of dirty, carnal power. As Salome reaches the extended final drydown, smoky leather and deep oakmoss begin to move in slower, more deliberate momentum, still every bit as carnal but now even deeper and more luxuriously vintage-feeling. Vibrant, erotic, classic and devastatingly gorgeous, Salome is another big win from one of the most exciting new houses in niche fragrance."," Jasmine, carnation, bitter red orange, Turkish rose, orange blossom, tobacco, hyraceum, styrax, vanilla, hay, patchouli, bergamot, oakmoss, cumin, birch tar, castoreum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/66503.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, jasmine
Black I Parfum Extrait,Widian," The original fragrance from Widian by AJ Arabia, Black I distinguishes itself from the flock of Euro/Oriental hybrids in a key way: while inspired by the grandeur of Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque in Abu Dhabi and rich with perfectly blended spices, Black I is not an ode to opulence. Yes, it's gorgeous, compelling, and exotic, but where another brand might have opted for overindulgence and complication, Black I is a streamlined delight: a mouthwatering, captivatingly individual concoction of spice, incense and woods that's as comforting and casually easy to wear as the hippest of modern perfumery could hope to produce. Black I opens with a simple, but extremely compelling, blend of cardamom and cinnamon- spicy but not nose wrinkling, with a savory subtlety that positively enchants. A heart of delicate incense and smooth cypress adds sophistication and depth, while the drydown of musky sandal and cedar contributes longevity and a sexy modern backbone. AJ Arabia's philosophy shuns gender categories and style classifications, opting simply to say, ""Wear What You Like."" We can assure you that we like Black I very much."," Cardamom, cinnamon, incense, cypress, sandalwood, cedar, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70900.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, cardamom
Black III Parfum Extrait,Widian," Vital and invigorating, but also deep and soulful, Widian's Black III is this architecturally-minded line's meditation on the most complex and compelling structure of all: human memory. Featuring a gorgeously balanced collection of crisp, energetic top notes and then a deeper, warmer heart and base, Black III emphatically achieves its concept by leaving the wearer enveloped in a state of nostalgic bliss. Black III opens with a springlike burst of fresh citrus and a mouthwatering spearmint that feels more compellingly fruity than bracing or chilled. The effect is striking and emotional, opening you to the warmth of the leather and dry wood heart notes, which have the evocative comfort of a sunbeam through a dusty library window. In the drydown, softly creamy sandalwood and a hint of vanilla further the relaxingly atmospheric sensation, without ever fully relinquishing the spark of the opening notes. The cumulative effect is, as AJ Arabia describes it, rejuvenating. Everyone's happy memories are different, but we're pleased to say that Black III is designed for all of them."," Bergamot, spearmint, leather, dry wood, vanilla, moss, patchouli, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70902.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Black IV Parfum Extrait,Widian," Soft, spicy, and deeply sensual, Widian's Black IV upends the normal conventions of spicy florals, using a deep, richly sweet fruit opening and a musky vanilla drydown to create a sexy, surprisingly unisex rose scent that has us captivated. Opening with a burst of juicy bergamot, Black IV quickly sweetens with an intoxicating confection of blackcurrant and prune notes, as deliciously dark as they are sugared. The floral heart of exotic, sensuous rose and white florals retains a carnally indolic element, while a smooth, animalic musk and vanilla drydown only further ups the seductive factor. At the same time, woodsy leather notes balance the femininity and add long lasting power. Make no mistake, Black IV is a floral- and an enticingly sexy one at that."," Bergamot, blackcurrant, prune, rose, white flowers, vanilla, musk, leather, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70903.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
L'Eau Scandaleuse Eau de Parfum,Anatole Lebreton," Because ""leather"" fragrances can span a wide variety of styles and notes, there's room for both creativity and disaster. Luckily, L'Eau Scandaleuse is a triumph: an exuberant, sensual leather shot through with bright fruits, narcotic florals and deeply sexy animalic notes to create one truly intoxicating leather scent. L'Eau Scandaleuse opens juicy and wild, with succulent peach and bergamot and sweet davana. The leather accord here is full-bodied and breathtakingly complex, neither screechy nor overly smoky but nuanced, natural and gently rugged, the lovingly aged leather of treasured heirlooms. Combined with a restrained dose of gorgeous, hypnotic tuberose, the results are achingly lovely. In the drydown, deep animalic notes join the harmony, stimulating the primal sensuality and balancing the florals. Leather scents this masterful are rare achievements for even experienced perfumers. With L'Eau Scandaleuse, Anatole Lebreton is staking his claim to that reputation right out of the gate."," Bergamot, peach, davana, tuberose, ylang ylang, leather, castoreum, cypriol, oakmoss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70801.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Alchemico Eau de Parfum,Mazzolari," The Mazzolari line has always embraced duality: a century of history but a newcomer to the niche fragrance scene, classic influences but modern compositions, Italian style and global influence. Alchemico, as the name appropriately suggests, is a fusion of all that Mazzolari was, is, and will be, a suitably dreamlike, yet contemporary, incense scent with classical leanings but thoroughly modern flourishes. Alchemico opens with an instantly compelling top note combining fresh, young rose with smooth cypress and a jolt of energized, crisp pepper, all blended seamlessly with compelling effect. In the heart, the main incense note hits a steady beat almost immediately, playing off the pepper to feel both languidly smokey and energetic all at once, while an earthy geranium note fleshes out the incense's rougher, deeper facets. In the drydown, this is accentuated even more with a spicy, grassy vetiver note, but just when it seems like Alchemico might go too far towards the earth, a soft, warm amber sends it back aloft, adding a lightly sweet undertone that floats the floral woodsiness to the surface yet again. As with any bout of alchemy, choosing the ingredients is only the beginning. It's the blend where the magic gets made."," Rose, cypress, pepper, incense, geranium, vetiver, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/32824.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, rose
Fougere Nobile Eau de Parfum,Nobile 1942," Fresh, vibrant and masculine, the fougere style is meant to stimulate the spirit and empower the wearer. With its bright, effervescent timelessness and rich aromatic soul, Fougere Nobile is a sparkling evocation of ocean breezes and rugged, wild coastline, a classically nostalgic fougere that transcends reductive simplicity with an earthy, richly resinous base. Opening with a crisp sparkle of bergamot, Fougere Nobile instantly invigorates with a complex aromatic blend including basil, lavender, and spicy black pepper. Resinous elemi adds an unexpectedly smoky, cool incense vibe, which is reinforced with light, spicy tobacco and earthy vetiver and patchouli. For any gentleman with an eye towards tradition but both feet firmly planted in the modern, Fougere Nobile is a fragrance of great distinction."," Bergamot, basil absolute, lavender, black pepper, elemi, geranium, aldehydes, tobacco, vetiver, tonka bean, patchouli, sandalwood, white musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/52313.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Spirituelle Eau de Cologne,Divine," Gorgeously musky, lusciously floral, timelessly elegant. Spirituelle is modern and classic at once, a soft, full-bodied bouquet of roses with an invigorating peppery opening and a sexy, warm drydown that makes us weak in the knees. Spirituelle showcases the type of versatility we've grown to love from Divine- sophisticated and composed enough to wear with a ballgown, gorgeous and fresh enough to turn heads in a t-shirt and jeans. You've smelled rose and musk together before, but you've never smelled it like this."," Pink pepper, sichaun pepper, geranium, labdanum, rose, cedar, amber, musk, incense",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/22715.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, pink pepper
L'Homme Sage Eau de Parfum,Divine," An incredible blend of spice, fruit, wood and incense that leaves us weak in the knees. The sage in the name refers not to the herb, but to wisdom. However, if we met anyone, man or woman, who smelled this good, their IQ would be the last thing on our minds.   A spicy opening of saffron, lychee, mandarin and cardamom entices us down a mysterious path where we discover woods amber, patchouli, immortelle and incense, all layering so beautifully that we can't tell where one ends and another begins. All we can do is revel in the enveloping, woodsy, earthy warmth. Serene and hypnotic, this is a scent that seduces quietly, but oh-so effectively."," saffron, mandarin, cardamom, lychee, aromatic woods, immortelle (or everlasting flower), patchouli, oak moss, amber, incense",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/22713.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, saffron
L'Etre Aime - Homme Eau de Parfum,Divine," Yvon Mouchel, dedicated the 7th addition to the world of Divine to a perfume we will never forget, the fragrance of the one we love.  Linked to its feminine counterpart by the same name, l'Ãªtre aimÃ© homme (The Beloved Man) also shares with it the main note, the everlasting flower. Focusing on the aromatic aspect of the plant, l'Ãªtre aimÃ© homme is a woody, boldly spiced scent the masculinity of which is not aggressive but unmistakable. The lively blend of lavender and bergamot gets an extra zing from ginger and a hint of greenness from basil. The piquant accord in the heart of the fragrance mixes helicrysium with cardamom. Amber, exotic woods, patchouli and vetiver provide a rich, dark background for the composition and lend the base a luxurious, classic feel. Masculine perfumery at its finest!"," bergamot, lavender, ginger, basil, cardamom, everlasting flower, cistus, sandalwood, vetiver, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/22714.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Augusto Eau de Parfum,Mazzolari," The legacy of the Mazzolari line dates back to the original Augusto Mazzolari, a late-1800's Milan barber renowned for the fresh, bright fragrances he would whip up on the spot for his customers. It continued through his grandson, also named Augusto, who took the family fragrance business and expanded it beyond the barbershop and out to the world. Now, Mazzolari honors both family and history with Augusto, a fresh, invigoratingly elegant scent appropriate for a gentleman of any era. Augusto opens with a tart, sparkling dose of bergamot and orange, made cool and refreshing with a spike of mint. A heart of rosewood maintains a sense of clean refinement, with geranium and lavender adding a smooth, masculine complexity. In the dry down, the depth and refinement of ambergris and sandalwood reinforce a sense of classic, understated sophistication. Equally perfect in any situation from the barbershop to the boardroom to the ballroom, Augusto is a testament to the storied history of one of our favorite houses."," Bergamot, sweet orange, mint, rosewood, geranium, lavender, vetiver, amber, sandalwood.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/32820.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Le Rose Eau de Parfum,Mazzolari," Like the perfect cocktail, the perfect dress, or the perfect sunset, a perfect rose perfume need not be loud, or flashy, or bogged down by excess detail. Instead, it needs only to be pure, delicate, and true to the subtleties of the queen of all flowers. Le Rose is all of these things, a breathtakingly elegant, beautifully understated rose par excellence meant for the woman who never chases trends but instead is in complete control of her own personal style. Le Rose, as you might imagine, opens with a sole focus on rose, and this one is lusciously delicate: fresh, lightly green, natural, and rich without ever seeming overpowering. Indian sandalwood enhances the rose's woodsier and creamier aspects, while a base of sheer white musk projects a lighter-than-air sexiness that lingers for hours. Le Rose is too straightforward to have a whole bunch of tricks up its sleeve- but this beautifully simple floral proves that one perfect trick is often all you need."," Rose, Indian sandalwood, musk.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/32821.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, rose
Pichola Eau de Parfum,Neela Vermeire Creations," Lake Pichola is the crown jewel and central focus of the princely city of Udaipur. A myriad of colourful historic, architectural and spiritual reflections reflect from the surface of this ancient yet manmade treasure - the sunlight and moonlight of each season bringing out the eternal and timeless beauty of the lake and the Rajasthan regionPichola, the latest fragrance from Neela Vermeire Creations, captures this beauty and era-spanning elegance in a symphony of fresh, vibrant orange blossom, tender tuberose, sweet ylang, and tart, crisp mandarin. A princely spice blend- redolent saffron, dry cinnamon, cardamom- dance atop the citrus and flower, while a resinous woody base, sandalwood and vetiver, add a touch of deeper contrast without ever weighing down the exuberance of this magical concoction.Like the reflections over the lake surface, constantly shifting but always reflecting the same colorful, diverse and impossibly rich city next to which it rests, Pichola is a fragrance of luxurious depth, gorgeous light, and immense character. Another triumph from Neela Vermeire."," Cardamom, cinnamon, saffron, juniper, magnolia, neroli oil, clementine, bergamot, orange blossom absolute, rose absolute, tuberose absolute, jasmine sambac, ylang-ylang, benzoin absolute, sandalwood, driftwood, vetiver from Haiti.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/56506.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, cardamom
O/E Eau de Parfum,Bogue Profumo," Like any great architect, Antonio Gardoni is obsessed with structure and balance, and the concept that any fragrance, no matter how big and complex, can stand on the head of a pin if the engineering is sound. So it should come as no surprise that O/E, Bogue Profumo's followup to last year's sensational Maai and Cologne Reloaded, is, like its predecessors, a paradox- an elaborately structured, hugely complicated edifice of bright, shining citruses, naturally green spices and florals, warm natural wood notes and sheer synthetic ones, and an underpinning of smoky animalic notes- all of which somehow lock together to form something bright, surprisingly light, and cheerfully uncategorizable.  The combinations are exquisite- an ultra-fresh bergamot opening stands atop a spicy, fresh herb garden of rosemary and thyme. Balsamic camphor cools off a bough of juniper, pine and cypress. A lilt of lush florals offset a benzoin-tinged resinousness, and a transluscent layer of iso-E super wraps it all together and marks the composition as unmistakably 21st century. Each bold stroke is effortlessly complimented with the kind of artistic and architectural virtuosity that balances, but never overlaps, leaving the finished product as impressive in its scope as it is wonderfully enjoyable. Halfway between acoustic and electric, digital and analogue, artisanal and industrial, indoors and outdoors, O/E is another triumph from a truly contemporary talent."," Bergamot, grapefruit, lemon, neroli, clove, black pepper, rosemary, thyme, camphor, Lebanon cedar, juniper, pine, cypress, rose, jasmine, vetiver, benzoin, tobacco, resins, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/66903.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Black Muscs Eau de Parfum,Alexandre. J," While plenty of fragrances use ""Black"" in the title to convey intense woods, or fierce, challenging animalics, Black Muscs, with its subtly sensational blend of citrus, lightly floral muskiness, and resonant amber, is far more aligned to the elegant universality of the color- more like a finely tailored tuxedo than a horror movie monster. Opening with a fresh bergamot and lemon blend, transitioning with a lovely rose and patchouli heart, and ultimately settling into a deep, confident amber-and-musk drydown pitched at just the right volume, Black Muscs is a perfect scent for anyone that carries themselves with dignity, but never lets it lapse into self-seriousness. Luxury needn't be pompous, but as Black Muscs proves, it should always be luxurious."," Bergamot, lemon, violet, rose, patchouli, amber, and musk.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/69002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Rose Oud Eau de Parfum,Alexandre. J," One of perfumery's most classic combinations is made new again with this sparkling, spicy oriental stunner. Opening with a burst of deliciously candied fruits, Rose Oud quickly transitions into full seduction mode with a deep, luscious rose note set against a rich, musky oud and white woods accord accompanied with rare saffron and a sweet note of patchouli. A base of deep vanilla and ambery musks maintains a sensual complexity for untold hours. Deep, complex and utterly swoon-worthy."," Rose, agarwood, musk, amber, lemon, olibanum and sandalwood.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/69005.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, rose
Vaniglia Eau de Parfum,Mazzolari," Mazzolari's Vaniglia presents all the charm and the enveloping warmth of a cozy vanilla scent.  Creamy caramel and the seductive fragrance of delicate exotic orchids produce a decadent marshmallow quality - the best marshmallow you've ever tasted. The exquisite floral notes of orchid are subtle, but they beautifully enhance the femininity of the fragrance, taking it to a softer, more refined place. Not too sugary or sweet, just a perfect taste of sweetness from Mazzolari."," Vanilla, caramel, orchid",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/32816.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, vanilla
Rudis Eau de Parfum,Nobile 1942," In ancient Rome, therudis was the wooden practice sword of a gladiator, worn into the arena as a symbol of his strength and valor. With Rudis, Nobile 1942 brings us a full portrait of one such ancient warrior, garbed in hardened leather armor, his sword adorned with flowers for courage and luck, fortified with wine and spirits for the battle that awaits. Rudis opens with an opulent blend of whiskey and leather, infused with tart fruits, smoky wood, buttery saffron, and the golden sweetness of immortelle. The leather feels as supple as expensive calfskin, but its luxuriousness has a sensual side from the musk and ambered warmth. A streak of red wine runs through the base, alongside roses redolent with patchouli and spice, balancing the raw masculinity of the opening notes and making Rudis feel both unisex and surprisingly modern. Sweet and spicy, golden and creamy, smoky and earthy, Rudis is an utterly intoxicating stitch in time connecting Europe's past, present, and future in an undeniably captivating fragrance."," bergamot, dried fruits, rose, geranium, clove, saffron, cedar wood, leathery notes, patchouli, vetiver, immortelle, musk and incense",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/52312.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Mohur Extrait Parfum Extrait,Neela Vermeire Creations," Mohur Extrait is based on the Mohur EDP fragrance but has a much higher concentration of perfume.  The perfume has been left to macerate far longer to transfer even more of the absolute to fragrance and allow the full range of notes to blossom. The complexity of the fragrance has increased considerably, intertwining wood, leather, spices, Oudh and the blooming rose in an intoxicating blend offering the ultimate olfactory experience to the perfume wearer.  To be used in moderation, like all finer things in life.Mohur Extrait is a numbered, limited-edition, one time offering."," Cardamom, coriander, ambrette, carrot seeds, pepper, elemi, iris, jasmine, rose, violet, almond, leather, sandalwood, amber, woody notes, patchouli, agarwood (oud), benzoin, vanilla, and tonka bean.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/56505.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, cardamom
Maai Eau de Parfum,Bogue Profumo," Maai is a stunning accomplishment in modern perfumery as it marries the very best of old-school chypre glamour and bold animalics with a refined elegance and smoothness. It opens with a burst of incredibly mossy greenness, fused with roses, jasmine, and green tuberose, all sprinkled with a transparent veil of golden, glittering aldehydes. The plush bouquet is mesmerizing in its depth, and harkens back to a time before IFRA/EU regulations, but it's truly heart-stopping when combined with the animalic elements. Musky, leathered, and skanky, they cast a mighty roar that transforms the delicate swirl of feminine florals into something more unisex with a masculine touch that will appeal to fans of the legendary Kouros or Muscs Koublai Khan. As Maai unfolds, balsamic resins awaken in the base to add subtle streaks of smokiness and honeyed sweetness. At the same time, the amber slowly turns the whole fragrance deeper, richer, and softer, coating the musky leather in its warmth and taming its skanky cry. In its drydown, Maai transforms into golden velvet with a smooth, plush mix of amber, musk, and oakmoss.We found Maai to be one of the boldest, most sophisticated chypres we've encountered in a while. A symphonic masterpiece in the vein of Jubilation 25 and Kouros, it is not a fragrance for the faint of heart but for those who have mourned the loss of vintage glamour with an animalic edge. Black-tie galas seem like a perfect occasion for this incredibly opulent, concentrated scent, but so are moments when you want to seduce with naked sensuality. Maai's unconventional heart beats with such wildness and passion, it feel almost alive. Yet, at the end of the day, everything pales before that luxurious oakmoss which is piled on in such lavish layers that it took our breath away. Maai is the epitome of sophistication in the grandest tradition of haute perfumery, and we're sure its timeless beauty will impress even the most jaded connoisseur."," tuberose, rose, jasmine, ylang ylang, civet, castoreum, hyraceum, dried fruits, sandalwood, oakmoss.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/66901.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, tuberose
Soleil de Jeddah Eau de Parfum,Stephane Humbert Lucas 777," Few places on the planet have a closer relationship to the sun than the Saudi Arabian city of Jeddah, the Bride of the Red Sea, gateway to Mecca and Medina. To honor a great city that is both religious epicenter and vacation destination, cultural capital and center of commerce, StÃ©phane Humbert Lucas chose to focus the one element equally present and central to all endeavors, and contained within the brilliant gold-metallic bottle is a sun-drenched, rapturously bright citrus-floral that gradually evolves to reveal hidden depths of Russian leather, Madagascar vanilla, buttery iris, and earthy amber. Like the multi-faceted city of Jeddah itself, the reasons for going and the reasons for staying may be entirely different. The initial brightness of Soleil de Jeddah is a thing of unapologetic beauty: tart, juicy lemon, pillow-soft Roman chamomile, and an exquisite osmanthus so mouthwateringly jammy that we've variously detected peach, apricot, lychee, and mango, albeit without any of the cloying sweetness that might accompany any of those notes in a lesser fragrance. In fact, for a fragrance this big and bright, it's a minor miracle that Soleil de Jeddah never deviates into reductive sweetness or overdone sour, which we can only attribute to the exceptional quality of the ingredients, as well as a lightly powdery iris root heart that seamlessly bridges the gap into the earthier, surprisingly sensual base. Once the Russian leather emerges, rich and resinous with a very slight smokiness, what might have seemed like a strange and unfamiliar progression is now natural, intriguing, and deeply satisfying. Like the beautiful, hand-milled golden honeycombed cap, the Jeddah sun shines brightly enough to bring everything together, with undeniably beautiful results."," Lemon, Roman chamomile, osmanthus, iris root, amber, earthy notes, iris butter, Russian leather, vanilla from Madagascar.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/65504.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, lemon
Magnolia Grandiflora - Sandrine Eau de Parfum,Grandiflora," Perfume lovers have long admired the author of the fiercely original Manoumalia, Sandrine Videault, a maverick artist who chose to work only on compositions she believed in, hence her tiny commercial production. Sandrine left us last year at a tragically early age. Her last gift to us, and to the Australian floral designer Saskia Havekes, whose soul and world Sandrine fell in love with, is her Magnolia Grandiflora.Magnolia Grandiflora Sandrine is part of a pair of fragrances, both dedicated to Grandiflora's namesake blossom. An unusual debut for a fledgling brand, but a vibrant, emotional tribute to the story behind the scents, since the other magnolia was composed by Michel Roudnitska, the son of Sandrine's mentors, Edmond and ThÃ©rÃ¨se. While Michel's magnolia is lush and sensuous, this fragrance captures magnolia on a summer morning in its first, luminous stage: a dewy rose-tinged bud, shimmering with the tangy zest of a grapefruit note.It's probably the first time I detect a chypre accord in the flower, Sandrine wrote.I didn't know it existed in nature. For me, it was the most important thing to say about this Magnolia. Of course, this flower smells of lemon, and also conjures a certain moistness, but there are also fruity notes of melon, watermelon, earthy notes, etc.A pure, graceful fragrance with a zest for life."," Lemon, grapefruit, white pepper, fresh garden accords, dry wood accords, marine-aquatic accords, musky accords",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64201.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, lemon
Monsieur Eau de Parfum,Pierre Guillaume Paris Black Collection," Monsieur is inspired by the exploration of a forest, where torrents and waterfalls from Auvergne's mountains carry along scents of moss, bark, wood, earth, and stone.  A harmonious blend of eight woody notes entwined with crushed leaves splashed by the mineral freshness of water spurting out of the rock.  Monsieur is a powerful, complex, and vibrant scent permeated with an organic sensuality.  It is both dry and green, mixing elements of grass, earth, crisp air currents, and damp stones.  Vetiver lovers will savor the soil-caked purity of the scent and wood aficionados will appreciate the elegant blend of poplar, cedar, and sandalwood - a true harmony of the forest in a fragrance."," Patchouli, Cedarwood, Vetiver and Sandalwood, Absolute of Poplar, Oakmoss, Incense Wood and Papyrus.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/54513.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, patchouli
Cologne Absolute Eau de Parfum,Tom Daxon," As the name would suggest, Cologne Absolute is Tom Daxon's take on a classic cologne, a fragrance at once supremely respectful of tradition and not at all beholden to it.  A beautifully rendered vision of soaring neroli layered with tart citrus, sharp aromatics and soft white flowers over an earthy base of patchouli and cypriol, Cologne Absolute conjures up the delightful feel of a jaunt to Italy in summertime; an easy, relaxed well-being that brightens and invigorates. It's fresh and sparkling and sunny. Unlike traditional colognes, however, Tom has taken these elements and distilled them into an Eau de Parfum strength elixir that keeps that magical, neroli-drenched sunshine lasting well into the evening hours."," Neroli, bergamot, tarragon, green violet leaf, lemon petitgrain, jasmine, lily of the valley, givescone, patchouli, cypriol",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/62602.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, neroli
Sicilian Wood Eau de Parfum,Tom Daxon," Inspired by the scent of a citrus grove warming in the sun, Sicilian Wood is a quintessential Tom Daxon fragrance: powerfully evocative, fascinating in its evolution and, ultimately, equal parts surprising and satisfying. The opening is a vivid citrus that is instantly captivating.  The blend of lemon, tangerine and bergamot is startlingly realistic  you can feel that little squirt of juice as you peel off the skin of a tangerine.  There is a hint of sweetness  like freshly-squeezed orange juice  as we move to a blend of gentle lily of the valley and jasmine.  Then strong, resolute cedar and sandalwood appear and the soul of the fragrance is revealed: rich, confident wood with a twist of citrus."," Lemon, tangerine, bergamot, cardamom, gaiac wood, jasmine, lily of the valley, amber cedarwood, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/62603.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, lemon
J'ai Fait Un Reve - Obscur Eau de Parfum,Majda Bekkali," Eclectic and extraordinary, J'ai Fait Un RÃªve Pour Lui (formerly Songe pour Lui) is confident in its oppositions and perfectly at ease with taking any expectations you might have from reading its notes and blowing em all sky high. A vibrant and spicy pink pepper opens with a single foot-stomp of an entrance, sending the singular message that bold can be firm without being brash. Austere woods and soaring, golden notes like saffron and jasmine absolute balance each other's intensity, deep and earthy versus airy and rich. The longer you wear it, the more you notice its yin/yang nature...an exciting and fragrant journey for the senses that keeps unraveling as it goes along. Perfect for a man who enjoys the unknown twists and variety that J'ai Fait Un RÃªve Pour Lui offers."," Pink pepper, bergamot, Egyptian jasmine absolute, vanilla flower, oud, saffron, Moroccan atlas cedar and cashmere wood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/60100.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, pink pepper
J'ai Fait Un Reve - Clair Eau de Parfum,Majda Bekkali," Both deep and ethereal, J'ai Fait Un RÃªve is like falling into dream. The opening is the sweet descent, a gentle fall down, down, down, with the smell of orange-like notes and orange blossom trailing along. The dream shifts, with a warm jasmine twisting sensually on a bed of precious woods and light incense, and the pulse is taken up a notch with labdanum, cumin and leather. Before things get too heated, an illuminating white musk begins to weave in, imbuing the fragrance with soft, clean notes and creating a sense of contentment and happiness. No dark edges here, just a wonderful center with depth around which a light musk swirl and dances without a care."," Petitgrain, elemi, cumin, currant leaves, orange blossom, jasmine, lisylang, castoreum, white musk, white cedar, guaiac, leather, labdanum, incense and papyrus",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/60101.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, petitgrain
Cristina Eau de Parfum,Hilde Soliani," Hilde Soliani's Cristina is part of her Gli Invisibili collection, and aptly so, as the scent is a subtle, comforting cloak of earth and amber like a guardian angel.  Cristina is named after one of Hilde's best friends, who loved the fragrance so much that she became the namesake.  Appropriately, the theme of friendship and duality is prevalent in the fragrance. Cristina combines two types of rare patchouli as essential ingredients in the composition; each bringing out the best in the other. The patchouli notes in Cristina have a subtle feeling of Incense and Oud-like familiarity, as if they possess the wisdom of multiple lifetimes. Vanilla and cistus labdanum provide the comforting heart of the fragrance, acting as the glowing center upon which the duet of patchouli thrives. Cristina defies all expectation of a patchouli fragrance, and even those that thought they were not patchouli lovers will be proven wrong."," Patchouli, labdanum, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/46625.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, patchouli
450 Eau de Parfum,Farmacia SS. Annunziata dal 1561," If we could smell the woods, meadows and flower garlands depicted in Sandro Botticelli's Primavera, their spring beauty might very well resemble 450 by Farmacia SS Annunziata, named after the 450 Jubilee of the ancient Farmacia, which was established in the year of 1561 in the San Nicolo monastery.450 gives the impression of being a rustic floral, the marriage of its notes joined together by the wind and sealed with kisses from the sun. With its brisk, aromatic citrus top notes, light rosy floral heart tempered by woods, and its ambery-musky base with a touch of incense, 450 is spring in all its rawness, freshness, and warmth. In the drydown, woodsy florals are softened by Florentine orris with its powdery, earthy gentleness and the ambery-vanillic sweetness of coumarin.A perfect unisex fragrance for hot weather, 450 could easily adorn (and cool off) the wearer of a seersucker suit or a white linen dress. Fresh, transparent, warm  and divine."," Musk, Iris of Florence, Amber, Aromatic notes, Incense, Vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/44015.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, musk
Emir Eau de parfum,M. Micallef," M. Micallef's latest creation, Emir, flaunts the use of complex and raw natural materials, in a unique East meets West composition. The splendid heart of oud and leather is gently softened by cedar and patchouli, giving it a comforting and resinous appeal. Savory pepper notes give this scent a masculine edge, and notes of orange and grapefruit perk it up, bringing it out of the agarwood forest and into the light. As it develops on the skin, Emir reveals a softer side of geranium and white musk, rounding out its olfactory composition perfectly. The ideal blend of oud, smoke, sweet, and spice, Emir is the perfect distinctive masculine fragrance to wear anytime, for any occasion."," orange, grapefruit, geranium, oud, black pepper, patchouli, cedarwood, leather, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/24529.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, orange
Mohur Eau de Parfum,Neela Vermeire Creations," The name refers to the most valuable gold coin in India's history, the last of which was minted in 1918. A way, perhaps, of underlining the value given to perfumery during the Mogul era, an art so highly considered that the most powerful empress of the Mughal dynasty, Noor Jahan, devoted herself to perfecting it.Though Mohur is built on the classic Eastern accord of rose and oud, with its powdery orris accords it also manages to conjure the opulence of classic French fragrances. It is also, despite the richness of its floral accords, a unisex scent, with leather effects alluding to high tea after a polo match in the British Raj, and perhaps a whiff of fine-milled English soap.But the real surprise in Mohur is the subtle Indian pastry accord tucked in the petals of its rose garden, with notes of carrot, almond, cardamom and ambrette, lending a tender touch to this majestic composition. If Patou had been Indian, this would have been Joy...Bottle design allows for either splash or atomizer spray (included)"," Cardamom, coriander, ambrette, carrot, black pepper, elemi,  Turkish rose oil, jasmine, orris, hawthorn, almond milk accord, leather, sandalwood, amber, patchouli, oudh Palao from Laos, benzoin, vanilla, tonka bean",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/56501.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, cardamom
Oro Eau de Parfum,Omnia Profumo," The power of gold (oro) has tugged at the human soul for millennia, bringing with it intense emotions and indescribable beauty and artistry. Translating gold's majesty and possibilities from the senses of touch and sight to smell was a Herculean task, and one Omnia Profumo spared no expense in doing. Oro is a shaded glen dappled with golden light, scented with light touches of fresh lemon and bergamot that meld with a breeze carrying a zingy, wild cyclamen. The breeze picks up with a gust of peony, lavender and spring lilac, and bids farewell as a rich and sensual vanilla/patchouli combination unfolds. The vanilla-like coumarin and exquisite sandalwood are perfect accompaniments-- you didn't think a perfume called Oro would be a coquettish giggle of a perfume, right?  Don't assume it's overly heavy or ostentatious; Oro is feminine and sexy without trying too hard, that just-right combo of sweet and dark that will have people running the wrong way down an escalator to ask you what you're wearing."," Lemon, Bergamot, Cyclamen, Lavender, Lilac, Peony, Patchouly Sandalwood, Coumarin, Incense, Vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/46105.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, lemon
Conaffetto Eau de Parfum,Hilde Soliani," A delightful, romantic filigree of almonds, sugar and soaringly lovely orange blossom. Created for a dear friend's wedding, Soliani was inspired byconfetti  the sugar coated almond candies served at weddings in Italy  and around the world.  You may know them better as Jordan almonds. This is not an easy, melt-in-your-mouth sort of candy. The sugarcoating is to convey the wish that the newlyweds' life be more sweet than bitter and the beauty of these candies is that the almonds really do have a sharp bitterness that contrasts with the powdery sweetness. That beguiling contradiction is captured perfectly in this scent and leads into an absolutely gorgeous profusion of fresh orange blossoms, as if you were walking under a wedding bower.  Conafetto features an absolutely radiant version of fleur d'oranger  a touch of honey, a touch of citrus and a bounty of ethereal white flowers. We can't imagine a more perfect scent for a wedding  but you don't need to be a bride to love this. Any time you want to dab on a dose of sheer joy, this would be appropriate."," Orange blossom, almond, sugar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/46614.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, orange blossom
Patchouli Nobile Eau de Parfum,Nobile 1942," Let's face it: Patchouli can be maddening to describe because it smells like nothing else in the world but patchouli. Yes, it's earthy and rich, but those adjectives fail to conjure up the hypnotic, evocative qualities that make patchouli so distinctive. Luckily, if we simply state the obvious  Patchouli Nobile is a patchouli scent  we have a good place to begin because we all know that deep, highly recognizable note. The question is, is it a good patchouli scent? Happily, the answer is yes. In fact, it's not just a good patchouli scent, it's a great one: It seduces without resorting to brute force, it has a caressing amber-tinged sweetness that nestles into the loamy richness of clean earth and smooth wood and it retains the dry freshness of its opening of incense and pepper. It is both elegantly refined and devastatingly sexy. The patchouli is absolutely present, but it's not overpowering, and the layers of sandalwood, oak moss, amber and tonka add a luxurious, velvety quality that makes this superbly wearable. It goes without saying that if you are already a fan of patchouli, you need to try this, but we feel that this cozy and alluring scent has the potential to win new converts to the patchouli cult, as well. Outstanding."," Citrus, white pepper, frankincense, patchouli, gaic wood, cistus, jasmine Moroccan cedarwood, amber, oak moss, sandalwood, tonka.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/52300.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, citrus
Estroverso Eau de Parfum,Nobile 1942," A sparkling burst of lemon, orange and tangerine gives this lively scent an opening as dazzling as the sun bursting through clouds. Estroverso is a combination of estro  the Italian word of inspiration and intuition  and verso (against)  -- and it is meant to convey that drive to follow inspiration against all odds. It is the passion of invention and creation, and that stubborn streak that compels you to pursue your dreams even when things look hopeless. The vivid citrus and herbs dance over a complex mÃ©lange of vetiver, ambergris, cedar and musk. This has the classic eau de cologne structure, but  heightened. The citrus is extra bright and the base is rich and complex. And there is a little bit of something edgy in there; we are assuming it's the mugwort, because it is what we would imagine a plant with startling healing properties and possible magical applications would smell like  green and potent. Overall, a scintillating potion that will keep you upbeat and alert while waiting for inspiration to strike."," Lemon, Orange, Tangerine, Lime, Rosemary, Mugwort, Cedarwood, Vetiver, Patchouly, Musk, Ambergris",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/52302.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, lemon
Ambra Nobile Eau de Parfum,Nobile 1942," A classic amber scent, impeccably done. Warm, powdery and  soothing. A fresh citrus and orange blossom opening leads us to the heart of ambergris, labdanum and patchouli. There is a startling hint of salt and stone in the transition and, though we quickly move past that into a smooth and comforting blend of tonka bean, vetiver, cedar and sandalwood, there is something intriguingly solid and cool beneath all the warm elements. This is a fragrance with presence: It has a soft, satisfying sweetness, but it's not candied or syrupy. It's calming, but it feels much too sophisticated to describe it as cozy. The word that leaps to mind is regal. It feels as if this was created for the exclusive use of nobility and we managed to sneak a bottle out of the palace for ourselves. Don't we all deserve to be treated like royalty sometimes? Pure elegance."," Neroli, Bergamot, Ambergris, Labdanum, Patchouly, Tonka Bean, Sandalwood, Cedarwood, Vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/52301.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, neroli
Note Vanillee Eau de Parfum,M. Micallef," We usually think of vanillas as of good girl scents, cozy scents, comforting scents... Micallef's Note Vanillee, with its impish licorice accord and a boozy undertone of cognac and rum is a girl gone bad, very, very bad. We can't get enough of the honeyed piquancy of the perfume, with its juicy mandarin and its seductive jasmine; the base of sandalwood, vanilla and smoky, sweet tobacco, rum and cognac is sinfully delicious. Micallef celebrates the fragranceNote VanillÃ©e in its new Art Collection, exclusively available at Luckyscent. The flacon is decorated with clear crystals and the exquisite silver-colored cap completes the touch of elegance that radiates from the flacon. It is more than a flacon, more than a perfume; it is a unique creation, a work of art."," mandarin, jasmine, honey, licorice, sandalwood, vanilla, cognac, rum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/24511.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, mandarin
Beachwood Eau de Parfum,Costamor," Costa Rica translates to rich coast and no perfume theme built around the country could be without a fragrant valentine to its amazing coastline. Beachwood moves away from the tourist hotspots and takes you to a sheltered cove on a protected beach.  A crescent of white sand backs up against a forested cliff while aquamarine water glistens and rolls and the clean, untouched aquatic notes fill the air. The subtle hints of jasmine, neroli and coconut serve notice that you are indeed in a tropical landscape, and woods, lavender and bergamot remind you of the forest on the cliffs.  Light, effortless and calm, Beachwood is light and easy to wear- making it a perfect choice for an everyday fragrance."," Bergamot, Mandarin, Neroli, Jasmine, Coconut, Cedar wood, Sandalwood, Amber, Musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/50004.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Sugarwood Eau de Parfum,Costamor," A soft, woody--almost gourmand-like perfume-- with a surprise twist: the sweet and strikingly fresh scent of newly cut sugar cane. Sugar cane is a cultivated crop in Costa Rica but it thrives so well in the idyllic climate that you find it growing wild, ready to be savored on a whim. This cherished treat inspired Sugarwood, which features sugar cane pulp as a primary note. Luscious fig complements the sweetness, while warm cedar evokes the woody aspect of the plant. Gentle floral notes - ethereal jasmine, lilting peony and a powdery iris - meld beautifully to create a feminine scent that is the ideal balance of sweet and sophisticated."," Bergamot, fig, sugar cane pulp, peony, jasmine, musk, iris, vanilla, cedarwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/50001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
L'etre Aime - Femme Eau de Parfum,Divine," At the heart of our lives is a perfume we will never forget, the fragrance of the one we love.  Yvon Mouchel created the 7th addition to the world of Divine around this theme. Linked to its masculine counterpart by the same name, l'Ãªtre aimÃ© femme (the beloved woman) also shares with it the note that lies in its heart: the everlasting flower with its warm, intense, sunny aroma. The feminine l'Ãªtre aimÃ© enhances the sun-filled quality of helichrysium with the bright, juicy citrus top notes. The dazzling accord of neroli, bergamot and nectarine gracefully leads to the equally radiant bouquet of the middle notes, in which everlasting flowers are mixed with jasmine, lily and rose. The base notes of amber, sandalwood vetiver and vanilla are trademark Divine, lush and elegant, the classic French perfumery at its best."," neroli, bergamot, nectarine, jasmine, lily, tincture of rose, everlasting flowers, labdanum, sandalwood, vetiver and vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/22705.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, neroli
Ambra Eau de Parfum ...,Omnia Profumo," An elegant and dry amber with a sparkling citrus opening. Despite the presence of heavy-hitter base notes like opoponax and patchouli, Ambra feels sheer and refined. The sweetness of the amber and vanilla is balanced with the sharp pepperiness of lavender and a cool, meditative blend of incense notes. This is an amber that is spare, rather than opulent, with a brisk spiciness that complements the sensuous warmth and makes this versatile and easy to wear. If you have been looking for an amber that is wearable day or night and that works in warm weather as well as cool, this is the one. It still has that golden, hypnotic quality that makes amber so addictive, but it is dry and subtle enough to work as an everyday fragrance."," Orange, bergamot, geranium, incense, lavender, patchouli, vanilla, labdanum, opoponax, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/46100.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, orange
Onice Eau de Parfum ...,Omnia Profumo," Not every fragrance can be described in a line or two  some take a winding path to get to their destination. Onice is one of those fragrances. It opens with a fresh, green, vegetal note. We smell celery, which isn't listed in the notes. Then we get the beginnings of a dense and complicated sweetness that reminds us of immortelle, which is also not listed in the notes. Just when we are about to ignore the notes altogether we get a definite dollop of licorice and a delightfully sweet pineapple  both listed and both very present as they waltz with a variety of partners. Delicate hyacinth, sharp mint, earthy cedar, a dusting of nutmeg. It's an enchanting and unusual journey, that appears to lead to different places for different people on some Onice is sweet and fruity, on others the green and wood notes dominate. The consensus is that it is light and fresh without being aquatic or soapy or citrus and that it is very hard to pin down exactly what it smells like, although we all agree that it smells quite good. Intriguing."," citrus, anise, lavender, licorice, peach, pineapple, rose, nutmeg, geranium, hyacinth, jasmine, ylang, mint, sandalwood, musk, cedarwood, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/46102.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, citrus
Vaniglia del Madagascar Parfum Concentration,Farmacia SS. Annunziata dal 1561," A classic, full-bodied vanilla  rich, creamy and sweet  that is a prime example of why vanilla scents are so very beloved. A hint of citrus leads to a delectable fruitiness and then it is full-on vanilla in all its luscious, craving-inducing glory. There are a lot of vanilla scented things in the world, but as any passionate vanilla fan will tell you, they are not all created equal. Quality matters, and a finely crafted vanilla scent is as different from the plasticky, mass-marketed versions as leather is from vinyl. It is no surprise that Farmacia SS Annunziata has given us a superlative version that is tantalizingly edible and utterly seductive. Floral grace notes and velvety amber add warmth and complexity, but they are in the mix as supporting players  dreamy, delicious vanilla is the star attraction here, and she deserves her spotlight. A must try for those looking for their Holy Grail vanilla scent."," lemon, floral notes, amber notes, Madagascar vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/44013.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, lemon
Reve en Cuir Eau de Parfum,Indult," Reve en Cuir was created by Francis Kurkdjian, the perfumer whose talent and work we admire, as an Indult for Scent Bar fragrance. Knowing our love for leather, you will not be surprised to learn that this Luckyscent exclusive is built on the rich leather accord. The traditional citrusy top notes are given a modern twist by the inclusion of spices, cardamom and cloves, and oregano. Instead of being typically fresh, bergamot and lemon in Reve en Cuir have a delicately candied quality and set the tone of the composition with a rich, indolent feel. Cedar and patchouli enhance the smoky character of the leather while never allowing it to become tarry. Oakmoss and vetiver lend the scent that elegantly earthy character that we adore in classical masculine perfumes, while vanilla compliments the citrusy-spicy side of the blend, softening the sharp angles and making Reve en Cuir indeed dreamy and sensual. Spicy, smoky leather with a dangerously appealing soft side  we fall for that every time. Reve en Cuir was conceived as a masculine creation, but as every woman who has ever borrowed her boyfriend's leather jacket knows  some rules are made to be broken."," Bergamot, Lemon, Cardamom, Oregano, Clove Bud, Texan Cedarwood, Patchouli, Oak Moss, Haitian Vetyver, Crystallized Vanilla Recent Press New York Times' Chandler Burr gives Reve en Cuir  Five Stars'Leather  old, dark, smoky, heavy  is diabolically difficult to adapt to an accessible 21st-century format. Under the creative direction of Maselli, Wright and Eastwood, Kurkdjian has succeeded masterfully. RÃªve is a delectable, edible, light-infused leather that is instantly legible, deliciously impossible, as if an HermÃ¨s belt had been candied and baked by a patissier. Technically perfect (it lasts and diffuses like clockwork), it is also an aesthetic triumph.

Cara Eau de Parfum,Farmacia SS. Annunziata dal 1561," Like taking a bite out of a meringue  the initial sugar crystal sweetness that melts into soft vanilla on your tongue, the powdery sensation of chewing the puffy white cloud of a cookie, the striking combination of richness and delicacy. Cara takes some of our favorite gourmand notes  sweet almond, golden caramel and milky vanilla  and makes them soft and airy by folding in dusky amber and talcum. The marshmallow sweet opening mellows into a dreamy vanilla-tinged veil of powder that melts into the skin, soothing and delicious. This is as comforting as a favorite cashmere throw, yet sophisticated enough to qualify as utterly grown up. The perfect thing to reach for when facing a thunderstorm or the possibility of running into an ex. Gentle and delicious, this is a must try for fans of vanilla or almond."," Amber, caramel, almond, talcum, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/44004.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, amber
Takis Eau de Parfum,Farmacia SS. Annunziata dal 1561," Streamlined and modern.  Dazzlingly sharp lemon and peppery sage set the stage with a brisk, take-no-prisoners policy, and a clean musk and straightforward rose sweep through with equal efficiency. But when a majestic blend of velvety vanilla, exotic ylang ylang and mellow aged oak rolls in, everything slows down and brisk, angular edges are transformed into the smooth, burnished lines of a contemporary sculpture.  Rounded and warm, with a sweet soapiness that is at once familiar and brand new -- like a new, improved soapiness that is a little bit spicier, a little bit creamier, a little bit more of everything we like about soap. Takis can range from a heightened skin scent to seductive night-on-the town scent once it settles in, depending on the chemistry of the wearer. Sophisticated and polished."," Lemon, thyme, sage, rose, musk, ylang ylang, vanilla, oak",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/44005.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, lemon
Perla Eau de Toilette,Farmacia SS. Annunziata dal 1561," A lovely yellow lemon drop  the perfect blend of sour and sweet  -- melts into a shimmering apricot glow as dollops of fluffy vanilla float by, like the pink tinged clouds of a fantastical sunrise.  An ambrosial summer blend  citrus and vanilla  - is taken to new heights by adding the magical radiance of osmanthus  at once floral and fruity, ethereal and adamantly present. Like its namesake, Perla is absolutely luminous on skin, with a sweetness that beckons rather than overwhelms and a dreamy, enveloping warmth. This makes us smile and we imagine that it will make everyone around us smile, as well. Transportingly pretty."," Lemon, osmanthus, amber, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/44006.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, lemon
Vanille Oud Eau de Parfum,M. Micallef," As far as we are concerned, there can't be too many great vanilla scents and there certainly can't be too many aouds. Combine the two, and we are smitten. We are addicted to this unique combo of creamy, dreamy vanilla and spicy, resinous aoud. It is a perfect yin and yang harmony. The caramel-like sweetness of vanilla mixed with ylang-ylang and prune softens the starkness of aoud. Oud, in turn, prevents the vanilla accord from being too predictably foodie and infantile. This is a vanilla fragrance for those who usually shy away from vanillas... and a perfect starter scent for those curious about ouds."," bergamot, ylang-ylang, prune, oud, caramel, musk, vanilla, benzoin",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/24513.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Gaiac Eau de Parfum,M. Micallef," The aroma of gaiac is complex, eluding definition. The precious wood smells balsamic and fresh, sweet and earthy and smoky. Micallef's rendition of gaiac is fittingly complex, inclusive of the many facets of the scent. Bergamot and jasmine infuse the blend with freshness, cloves add spice, vetiver brings out the earthiness of the wood and vanilla sweetens the blend, softening the sharp angles, turning Gaiac into a sensual and tranquil perfume, with a your-skin-but-better base. Perfect for men and women."," bergamot, jasmine, cloves, gaiac, vetiver, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/24518.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Homme (Aoud) Eau de Parfum,M. Micallef," Micallef's spicy, honeyed rendition of precious aoud, with its mix of golden saffron and dark-red roses, is sensual and wonderfully exotic. The dry smokiness of the fragrance makes us think of the ritual in Arabia, in which women stand over an oud burner, perfuming their skin and clothes with the unique, enthralling fragrance. Balmily sweet and spicily bitter, Micallef's Aoud is a complex, endlessly intriguing scent. It is said that sandalwood is the fragrance for novices, while aoud is for thosein the know. Micallef's refined creation is our treat for true connoisseurs."," rose, aoud, sandalwood, cinnamon, saffron, nutmeg, honey, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/24519.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, rose
Avant Garde Eau de Parfum,M. Micallef," The new masculine offering from Martine Micallef delivers the great promise of its name. The complex composition, built on the contrast of fresh and smoky, dry and almost gourmand, is as unconventional and modern as the name suggests. We love how perfectly the sweet smokiness of tobacco mixed with cocoa balances the striking freshness of the citrusy top notes. The incense and leather blend in the heart of the fragrance is incredibly alluring, a brooding, dark and handsome accord that we find irresistible. The base of tonka bean and amber finishes the development on a softer and wonderfully sensual note. Charismatic blend that feels as contemporary as it is classically elegant."," bergamot, grapefruit, cocoa bean, tobacco, incense, Russian leather, tonka bean, grey amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/24520.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Manakara Eau de Parfum,Indult," The second we smelled this, we were positively overcome by its exotic yet approachable beauty. Named for a village in Madagascar known for its legendary lychee fruit (also spelled litchi), it's presented here as a sweet, honeyed and mysterious floral-tinged pudding-like fruit fragrance with amazing hidden depths -- not purple berry fruit, not bright citrus fruit, but rich and delicate lychee, a scent that's like tropical fruits meets ripe red fruits with a soft, creamy floral mixed in. We've never smelled anything quite like it --  ever -- and we had gourmand lovers, fruity fans, floral worshippers and even deep, dangerous fragrance lovers sampling this and positively banging their wrists on the counter demanding to buy it...and we didn't even carry it yet.  A custardy, creamy sweet fruit dessert of a perfume laced with rose water, we can't compare it to anything you've ever tried before and we're quite certain you'll be utterly smitten by this rare beauty. Moist, sweet, rich and delicate...all at the same time."," rose, lychee",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/37400.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, rose
Isvaraya Eau de Parfum,Indult," In India, patchouli is associated with Vishnu, the god savior of mankind and life and the guardian of universal harmony.  Isvaraya meansdivine in Hindi and this perfume is the olfactory fantasy of both modern India and spiritual India, an exotic elixir that blends light patchouli with smooth Indian plum tree and wraps it in jasmine. Although it centers on patchouli, it's not overly earthy. It's rich and unusual, slightly sweet and a tad smoky, a fevered evening spent on multi-hued silken sheets while wisps of incense burn sensually in the corners of your mind. The beautiful starkness of jasmine lights the darkness of patchouli and the deep, spiced fruitiness of the plum tree... utterly unique and completely exotic, Isvaraya is not a fluffy little fragrance you wear without thinking. When you smell Isvaraya, you close your eyes and dream and your spirit is at peace."," Patchouli, Indian plum tree, jasmine",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/37402.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, patchouli
L'Inspiratrice Eau de Parfum,Divine," L'Inspiratrice, the new offering from the very elegant Divine collection of scents, is a supremely sensual fragrance that displays the refined, classic quality, which we consider to be Divine's trademark in perfume. The dark-red, honeyed warmth of the roses, enhanced by the sweet creaminess of ylang-ylang, vanilla and tonka bean, is combined with the dry and at the same time almost-gourmand earthiness of patchouli and the greenness of vetiver. A delicate sparkle, added to the composition by bergamot and peony, is utterly charming. L'Inspiratrice is bound to please even the most sophisticated of seductresses. Very chic. Truly Divine."," Rose, ylang-ylang, vanilla, tonka bean, vetiver, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/22704.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, rose
All That Matters Eau de Parfum,Anamor," A subtle and elegant skin scent.  Deceptively simple in composition, All That Matters is one of those fragrances that merges with your skin and reads more like an aura than a perfume. This simplicity works because of the quality of the ingredients. Any musk lover can tell you that not all musk is created equal. The musk at the heart of All That Matters is smooth, with a silken lightness that is almost airy. This particular musk is also very rare and prohibitively expensive  therefore it is infrequently used in commercial fragrances except in tiny amounts. In this handcrafted blend, however, it is the star player -- paired with gorgeous and compelling sandalwood oil from East India and the delicate crispness of lily of the valley. Quiet and compelling. Discreetly seductive."," musk, sandalwood, lily of the valley",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/33300.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, musk
Mazzolari Eau de Toilette,Mazzolari," Mazzolari's signature scent is a rich, lush, wood-filled brew guaranteed to cause mass swooning.  It oozes class and beauty, a deeply green, woody fragrance softened by citrus and warmed by sandalwood.  Vetiver and cedar offer majestic backbones to this remarkable brew, and we can't think of anything better than curling up next to someone wearing this, a roaring fire, a glass of cognac and a sky full of stars. Dizzyingly seductive, romantic and deep."," Sandalwood, vetiver, spices and subtle citrus and green notes",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/32807.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, sandalwood
Lui Eau de Toilette,Mazzolari," Potent and virile, Lui is the fragrance of a refined man with a wild streak a mile wide.  Rich with patchouli, vetiver and leather, this is a complex and unguarded scent, completely comfortable on the skin yet smokin' hot underneath.  Hints of sandalwood tame the wild animal, while a dark amber and rich musk enhance the raw sensuality of Lui.  Raw and elegant at the same time, Lui is an uninhibited fragrance for a man who likes to keep everyone guessing...and just a little on the edge."," Sandalwood, cedar, patchouli, ambergris, vetiver, spices",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/32809.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, sandalwood
L'ame Soeur Eau de Parfum,Divine," Named after the most intense and beautiful of encounters, L'Ã¢me SÅur (Soulmate) is an homage to the meeting of kindred spirits.  This fragrance epitomizes a harmony beyond time, an eternal marriage of noble flowers and aldehydes.  Jasmin, otto of Bulgarian rose and ylang from the Comoro Islands are decadent, elegant florals that, when combined with ambergris, form a union of timeless beauty.  Naturally seamless and filled with innate sensuality, L'Ã¢me SÅur is modern example of ancient French perfumery at its most alluring."," jasmine, otto of Bulgarian rose, ylang, ambergris",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/22702.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, jasmine
Eau Capitale Eau de Parfum,Diptyque," When a brand as synonymous with niche fragrance as Diptyque decides to create a scent celebrating the city of Paris,  the possibilities are almost overwhelming. What kind of scent could possibly capture the entirety of the rich,  multi-textured relationship between The City of Lights and the house of Diptyque? But of course,  there actually is a perfect answer- the chypre,  iconic amongst perfume styles,  a legendary accord with a thousand facets. But with the classic chypre so instantly identifiable- bergamot,  rose,  jasmine,  patchouli,  oakmoss- it's incumbent on any re-interpretation to bring something new and unique to the proceedings. Thus,  Eau Capitale is a chypre both respectful of tradition,  and yet uniquely and romantically modern- a dynamic new study of balance and contrast featuring a fresh yet timeless take on the beloved style. It still boats a lively citrus opening,  but with a twist- an especially green ""vert de bergamote"" of pronounced energy,  paired with a burst of pink peppercorn,  unique to the chypre style,  which gives a cool,  sparkling opening of notable modernity. The heart has a classic rose presence,  but utilizing three distinctive expressions of Damascene rose: an essence,  an absolute,  and a concentrate,  for a truly multifaceted and complex floral experience. And finally,  in place of the traditional oakmoss base,  a patchouli ""coeur, "" a fractional extract with a brighter character than traditional patchouli,  which closes us on an invigorating and modern high. Bright,  fresh,  romantic,  and nuanced,  Eau Capitale is a dynamic new chypre that proves that there's still ample life left in the classics- a fitting tribute to Paris if ever there was one."," Bergamot, pink pepper, rose essence, rose absolute, rose concentrate, patchouli coeur",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/483400.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Fougere L'Aube Eau de Toilette,Rogue Perfumery," Boy, Manuel Cross wasn't messing around when he made FougÃ¨re L'Aube. Modelled after the first fougÃ¨re ever to be made, the original FougÃ¨re Royale by Houbigant, FougÃ¨re L'Aube heralds a triumphant return to the unapologetically masculine roots of the fougÃ¨re concept  the fresh, bitter aroma created by the marriage of lavender, oakmoss, and labdanum, given aromatic interest by way of minty geranium leaf and the sting of camphor.FougÃ¨re L'Aube is much more than a simple re-tread using great raw materials and real oakmoss, however. True to its name  which means fougÃ¨re of the dawn'  this scent opens with a burst of sparkling lemon and lavender, for a sunny garrigue' effect that's much brighter than the traditional fougÃ¨re opening led by bergamot. The bitter green galbanum and dry hay soon move in to darken the foresty shadows, though, and with the cool rosy-minty sting of geranium in the background, the oft-cited reference to the scent of ferns (fougÃ¨re meaning fern' in French) for once makes perfect sense. This is really old school, masculine canon  strictly for lovers of classic fougÃ¨res like Azzaro Pour Homme, Brut, and crisp green scents such as Green Irish Tweed."," lavender, oakmoss, geranium, citrus, hay, galbanum, costus, musk, sandalwood, camphor, amber, Moroccan rose",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/838000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, lavender
Medie Eau de Parfum,Cire Trudon," MÃ©die is a symphony of citrus: the perfume's roots evoke the Antiquity and the kingdom of Alexander the Great, under which the province of MÃ©die abounded with rare citruses. An oasis of freshness, MÃ©die encapsulates the very heart of the fruit where citrus, spices and aromatic notes blend. In addition, bright green scents are combined with clear amber and woody notes, warmed up by a touch of incense. Composed like a citrus fragrance with an aromatic finish, MÃ©die leaves a vibrant bitterness in the air."," Grapefruit, Green mandarin, Sambac jasmine",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/559081.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, grapefruit
L'Eau des Sacres,Reims Parfums," L'Eau des Sacres executes its leap between its cool-toned, aromatic opening and its warm, golden drydown so effortlessly that it feels like watching the prima ballerina at the Paris Opera performing a piquÃ© turn for you alone. Opening in a cloud of peppery violet-and-lavender brightness, the scent feels ethereal yet unpretentious, like wandering into a small, rustic French church at Easter and inhaling the scent of flowers and herbs being placed over nubbins of waxy, lemony frankincense. Wafts of honeyed orange blossom add to the spring-like delicacy and brightness.It's in the basenotes that things take a seriously sensual tone. Dropping the aromatic herbs and petals of its opening, the scent dips us backwards into a warm bath of buttery, almond-inflected tonka bean, bolstered with a gorgeous buerre noisette' sandalwood. Lovers of Tonka ImpÃ©riale will rejoice in this drydown  similarly warm and comforting as the Guerlain, L'Eau des Sacres is perhaps even more natural-smelling and durable. A touch of ambergris adds an agreeably salty-fresh bitterness that keeps the sweetness in check. We think that that L'Eau des Sacres' a little from column A, a little from column B' approach creates the perfect all-season bridge between the freshness of aromatic spring florals and the buttery winter weight of tonka-fied amber."," Pink pepper, lavender, orange blossom, honey, rose, tonka bean, sandalwood, ambergris",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/82401.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, pink pepper
B683 Eau de Parfum,Marc-Antoine Barrois,"I like the raw and yet so chic aspect of this perfume: a very refined and wild fragrance.  Quentin Bisch, perfumerB683 is a result of the meeting of two young designers. One is a couturier, the other a perfumer. Their childhood memories brought them together. Remembering captivating smells; of the leather from an elegant attachÃ© case or an immaculate desk blotter; of the distinct smells of wood during the regular gathering of fuel to warm the family home. The artistic skills of the former and the olfactory talent of the latter together sparked a magical and pleasant fragrance with its notes of spices, leather and wood. What We Think An oh-so-wearable leather scent that feels smoothly sophisticated but dynamically modern- the spice and woods add tone and energy without sacrificing elegance."," Black Pepper, Saffron, Chili Pepper, Nutmeg, Violet Leaf, Amber, Cistus Absolute, Musk, Patchouli, Santal Wood, Oakmoss, Ambroxan",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/822000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, black pepper
Sabbia Bianca Eau de Parfum,Profumum," Concentrated at a whopping 43% of pure perfume oil and playing host to some of the world's most exquisite natural floral absolutes, Sabbia Bianca is the Rolls Royce of the Big White Floral genre. The composition is uncluttered, with only four listed notes. That's because when you go to the trouble of sourcing the best and most expensive tuberose, ylang, and tiare, you want their beauty to be able to shine uninterrupted. Sabbia Bianca is the perfect fantasy of a tropical island in a bottle, complete with sugar-white sand, crystalline azure waters, and gently-swaying palm trees. Immediately upon application, you are plunged into a pool of lush, inviting coconut milk, its surface dotted with waxy tiare petals. The buttery tuberose and gardenia are huge, and so heavily narcotic that you feel as if you've sipped on moonshine made from tropical flowers. Although Sabbia Bianca is almost obscenely rich, flickers of a woody freshness here and there hold the perfume back from excessive sweetness - perhaps the banana leaf nuance in the ylang or the greenness of the violet. That said, keep in mind that just one drop of this super concentrated elixir is enough to radiate heady tropical warmth all day long. Our take on Sabbia Bianca is this: sometimes you have to go all out to experience perfection in a genre. And for us, Sabbia Bianca is worth the investment."," tuberose, violet, ylang ylang, tiare",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/33948.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, tuberose
Sundrunk Eau de Parfum,Imaginary Authors," ""Woozy and warm from the sun, we shared an orange pop and watched the surfers' last lines of the day.""Amy ObisboBlindingly bright, captivatingly crisp, Sundrunk explodes onto the palate with electric notes of citrus spiked with a vibrantly herbaceous sheen. It's the rich, dizzy, warm-to-your-fingertips feeling of an afternoon running with friends in the blinding brightness, sharing toasts to life and youth and creativity, and collapsing in a tired, satisfied heap as the afternoon crawls by. With a delicious, thirst-quenching combination of shimmering orange, smooth florals and tantalizingly tart rhubarb, one sniff is enough to soothe, energize, and delight, all at once. Sundrunk's extraordinary freshness may not last forever- but when you're under its spell, it sure feels like it will."," Neroli, rhubarb, honeysuckle, rose water, orange zest, first kiss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77515.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, neroli
The Time Eau de Parfum,The House Of Oud," What a beautiful, refreshing tea scent! Fans of tea scents know that a good one is difficult to find; well, House of Oud's The Time is a good one. The opening of bergamot, chamomile, and wormwood note creates a superb green tea impression, uniquely fresh and bitter, but with a nutty hay-like undertone. Slowly, other types of tea notes start to feed into the scent, helping to round out the picture and fill in the gaps. Oolong tea adds a milkiness that softens the astringency of the green tea, rendering it cloudy, while a black tea note lends a smoky leathery nuance. Together, the combination of the different teas gives the scent a subtleroasted undertone.   There's a series of contrasts at play here that works very well. The Time smells both fresh and comforting, milky and smoky, which all adds up to a sort of green-on-cream effect. The nubuck suede notes in the base tie it all together for an experience that feels like drinking a cup of green tea in an upmarket equestrian store, surrounded by the complex aromas of saddle leather, tea leaves, and even the polite suggestion of hay. We're confident that fans of refined leather-tea fragrances such as Memo's Eau de Memo and Hermes' Osmanthe Yunnan will find a new love in The Time."," Bergamot, wormwood, chamomile, oolong tea, iris, lemon verbena, cedar, musk, amber, black tea",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76422.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
20 Mars 2022 Eau de Parfum,Rundholz Parfums," What does the future smell like? Obviously, we'll have to wait to know for sure, but with 20MARS2022, Rundholz for the first time explores the scent of a date not yet reached- and they're reaching for the stars. Opening with an intensely peppery explosion quickly warmed with a bouquet of refined gourmand spice, delicately sweetened with a touch of fruit and a rich, but restrained floral heart. The true star, as with all Rundholz scents, is the deep, balsamic incense that emerges in the heart, rich and resinous, made lightly smoky with a touch of crÃ¨me brulee vanilla and haylike Tonka bean, given a sensual animalic growl with civet and castoreum.  Overall, the effect is enveloping, the kind of deep, wondrous incense scent where each sniff reveals a new facet. Sure, we know the ""Mars"" in 20Mars2022 refers to the month, and not the planet. But with a scent this out of this world, you'll have to forgive us for not always remembering that."," Pink pepper, black pepper, saffron, lovage, cinnamon, strawberry, jasmine, lily of the valley, rose, frankincense, patchouli, vetiver, sandalwood, cedarwood, nagarmotha, hay, vanilla, Tonka bean, labdanum, musk, civet, ambergris, castoreum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/67803.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, pink pepper
Wulong Cha Extrait de Parfum,Nishane," Wulong ChÃ¡ is a vibrant, woody fig tea with a refreshing twist of citrus to give it sparkle. It opens with an Earl Grey type of freshness, with black tea leaves oily with bergamot, orange, and an exotic, fruity lift that is not immediately identifiable (that would be the litchi). But the heart is pure Oolong: a smoky tea full of delicate, nutty roasted flavors, and a slight but noticeable milkiness. The introduction of the fig note in the heart adds to this impression of milkiness; it smells beautifully like a freshly snapped fig leaf, green and oozing with fig sap.What a lovely balance of tannins, fruit, and milk this is. We like Wulong ChÃ¡ because it has both the clean, fresh transparency we've come to expect from great tea fragrances, but also a sweet, figgy milkiness that rounds off any sharp corners. In the later stages, a gauzy white musk, as soft as a pillow and spiced gently with nutmeg, wraps everything up in a light, silky embrace. Wulong ChÃ¡ is a refreshing wear, especially in summer, but it's also insanely soothing. Strictly to be worn with a white linen shirt and a mint julep in hand."," Bergamot, orange, lychee, mandarin, oolong tea, nutmeg, musk, fig",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77417.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Guimauve de Noel Eau de Parfum,Parle Moi de Parfum," Selected by Denyse Beaulieu to feature in her top 10 of 2016 for Grain de Musc, Guimauve de NÃ¶el is a pillowy marshmallow scent flavored with orange flower water and dusted in enough powdered sugar to make your teeth ache. But while it reminds us most pleasurably of fougassette, a type of bread fragrant with orange flower water sold in every market in Provence, this is not at all a heavy, gluttonous fragrance. Rather, it is a tender puff of orange flower-scented air with the sparkle of sugar crystals. It has a very French character, reminiscent both of those little chouquettes eaten by French schoolchildren at snack time, as well as the milky vapors of their evening baths, orange flower water sprinkled liberally into the water by Maman. Guimauve de NÃ¶el is a frothy, tender delight that is just perfect for celebrating the innocence of youth and the joy of family life. If you are a lover of By Kilian's Love or Eau Aimable by Le Couvent des Minimes, then you will adore Guimauve de NÃ¶el."," Orange blossom, vanilla, sugar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76701.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, orange blossom
Vetiver Moloko Eau de Parfum,Ex Nihilo," To the initiated, Moloko, the futuristic cocktail in A Clockwork Orange, conjures all sorts of associations: futuristic mod fashion, milky whiteness, and a dangerous, intoxicating vitality. With Vetiver Moloko, Ex Nihilo capitalizes on that imagery, delivering a fragrance on the one hand earthy and spiky, on the other soft and milky, which combine for an addictive, slightly unnerving symphony of scents that evolve on the skin with fascinating effect.Vetiver Moloko opens with bright, lightly bitter bergamot and soft rose notes, revealing its dual nature straight from the beginning. In the heart, the tantalizing milk accord blurs the olfactory picture for a narcotizing effect, while woodsy cypress buzzes along the surface. Once the vetiver reveals itself, we realize just how potent this cocktail has been all along, while a drop of vanilla at the end re-balances. Whether you're out with the droogs or on the prowl for a chelloveck or devotchka, Vetiver Moloko is not to be missed."," Bergamot, Bulgarian rose, cypress, milk accord, vetiver, amyris, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/72007.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Fleur Narcotique Eau de Parfum,Ex Nihilo," While the Left Bank gets all the traditional credit for being Paris' arts and cultural center,  everyone knows that it's the Rive Droite,  with its bustle,  style and know-how,  where the new generation is coming to life. Fleur Narcotique,  an airy,  vibrantly juicy floral designed as Ex Nihilo's ""interpretation of the new Rive Droite woman, "" is both sophisticated and seductive,  indicative of the 21st century Paris,  where tradition and modernity walk thrillingly hand in hand. Fleur Narcotique opens with a vital and fruit-laden set of top notes,  with bright,  energetic bergamot embracing a burst of juicy peach and exotic,  fruity lychee. In the heart,  the rich lusciousness of jasmine meets the fresh beauty of peony,  with light,  white orange blossom lending texture and depth. As Fleur Narcotique dries,  a rich but transparent base of wood,  musk and moss keeps the dreamily narcotic effect alive for hours,  keeping you sniffing again and again. The modern Rive Droite woman is a complex and sophisticated blend of substance and panache. Who doesn't want to smell like that?"," Bergamot, lychee, peach, jasmine, peony, orange blossom, wood, moss, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/72002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot

JF begins with an invigorating burst of bergamot, lemon, lime and mandarin in combination with an intensely aromatic blend with armoise, coriander and clary sage.

Bois d'Ascese Eau de Parfum,Naomi Goodsir," A meditative swirl of serene incense, intensified by smoked wood. At first, this brings to mind a stark, secluded chapel and a life of plain and simple pleasures. But as it develops, notes of whiskey, tobacco and cinnamon begin to shimmer through the incense, and you start to think that perhaps these pleasures won't be quite so plain, after all. If you have ever enjoyed a fine Islay Scotch whiskey, such as Lagavulin or Laphroaig, you are familiar with the way the intricacies of smoke and moss add a complicated and enigmatic appeal  harsh and medicinal one moment, mesmerizing the next. The layers of smoked cade wood, oakmoss and whiskey have a similar effect here, as bracing jolts of smoke morph into the airy tranquility of incense, keeping us endlessly intrigued and hopelessly addicted.  A starkly elegant fragrance that puts us in a trance.All Naomi Goodsir Parfums include an atomizer spray."," tobacco, whiskey, cinnamon, amber, cistus labdanum, oakmoss, smoked cade wood, Somalian incense",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/59301.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, tobacco
Eau Duelle - Eau de Toilette,Diptyque," Eau Duelle is a vibrant dash of cold spices - cardamom, pink peppercorn and saffron - and the intoxicating juniper essence hits new heights with fresh cypress and elemi aromatic tinges. Then the vanilla emerges triumphant against the light and dark backdrop.On the one hand, there is ethereal, epicurean and powdery Firnat vanilla, its enthralling sweetness exalted by paradisone - a Firmenich captive molecule akin to an infinitely pure hedione - and by white, sweet and enveloping musks.On the other, there is original and mysterious bourbon vanilla. It is slightly smoked and almost syrupy. Vetiver, African frankincense smoke, and animal and leathery twists from Asian cypriol purify it. A spice trail necessarily travels through places where unexpected exchanges occur.The gatecrashers here are black tea from Ceylon and the famous calamus reed, the tasty revealers that make the journey singular, memorable and priceless. Eau Duelle will delight anyone who dreams of breathing vanilla with a different tinge. It is neither languid nor docile: it is enthralling in an all-new way."," Cardamom, Asian cyprus, elemi, juniper, saffron, calamus, black tea, black African olibanum, amber, Firnat Vanilla, Bourbon Vanilla, white musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/48314.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, cardamom
Nio Eau de Parfum,Xerjoff," Xerjoff describes Nio asA refreshing walk through the south Italian countryside,  and they couldn't be more right. Wearing Nio,  we imagine strolling down a shady,  cypress-lined lane in the height of summer,  just before the sun sets. It's that special time between day and night,  the time the French refer to as the blue hour. A slight breeze lifts from a nearby ocean,  cooling the warm air and mingling with the fresh,  herbal scent of the trees and their woody bark. Soon night will fall and the crickets will begin to chirp. We're thinking of the chilled Campari and good company waiting at the villa just ahead. Nio opens with a mouthwatering blend of rich neroli and Calabrian bergamot before deepening into its resinous,  green heart. Hints of spice,  pepper,  and dry cedar enliven the composition,  and vetiver keeps Nio's refreshing fragrance grounded. Unlike many green,  earthy fragrances,  Nio doesn't fade into a vague woody shadow. Instead,  it retains its refined vivaciousness for hours and hours,  alternately showing its uplifting then mysterious aspects. Nio is the rare fragrance that is fresh without being jarring and elegant without being stuffy."," Neroli, Calabrian bergamot, cardamom, nutmeg, pink pepper, green leaves, cedar, gaiac wood, Haitian vetiver, Indian patchouli, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/51108.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, neroli

Phtaloblue Eau de Parfum,Tauer Perfumes," While everyone loves the sparkling brightness of an aquatic scent, it's hard to deny that the vast majority of them are all a bit... repetitive. So when we say Phtaloblue, with its distinct and invigorating blend of herbaceous and woody aquatic accords, is a breath of fresh air, please understand that we mean that in every possible sense. We'd expect nothing less from one of the most uniquely creative perfumers we know. Phtaloblue explodes off the skin with a delightfully bracing burst of oceanic freshness, salt water mingled with vibrant citrus, but also a distinctive and captivating note of sweet, aromatic fennel that instantly imparts a warm, sensual dimension. It's the perfect opening for a scent that provides cool comfort and provocative originality on every level, as a floral heart balances the classic sophistication of orange blossom and lavender against a second, more herbaceous fennel and geranium chord that crackles with electric energy. Fresh and sweet, it all feeds into a gently but brilliantly gourmand base, with the smoothness of cedarwood and balsamic amber providing the perfect contrast to bring out the most in a dried tonka note that evokes both mouthwatering vanilla alongside the ingredient's haylike, outdoorsy qualities. The cumulative effect is a redefinition of the aquatic genre, elegant yet easygoing, invigorating and relaxing all at once. Andy Tauer doesn't create ordinary fragrances, and Phtaloblue proves it yet again.

Tuberose & Moss Eau de Toilette,Rogue Perfumery," With striking facets that range from innocently soft to sinfully carnal, tuberose is a grand dame of perfumery, a floral that a perfumer could dedicate a lifetime to. And Manuel Cross' third installment of tuberose is his most creative yet: while Flos Mortis was a snarling bouquet of indole (and Champs Lunaires a smooth and gentle dream), Tuberose & Moss focuses on tuberose's sweet, fruity elements, and in doing so demonstrates that this complex floral can do joyful and bright just as well as dark or soft. And what better base to showcase the sunshine than a classically inflected chypre? Here, Cross plays a fruity, creamy tuberose- delivering the brightness and sweetness that traditionally come from citrus and resin- against a beautiful base of soft, green, real oakmoss. Touches of spice, vanilla, and woods round out the rich dimensionality of the tuberose, and a traditional note of labdanum keeps the tuberose tethered to a chypre structure. Yet again, Manuel Cross has given us a scent that shows us that while both beautiful raw materials or inspired creativity can produce a great fragrance, it's the intersection of the two that can truly speak to the spirit."," Tuberose, Oakmoss, Vanilla Cream, Allspice Berries, Cedar, Labdanum, Musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/838009.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, tuberose
L'Aimee Eau de Parfum,Parfums MDCI," L'AimÃ©e,  or ""The Beloved, "" is a famous 1794 oil portrait from French master Jacques-Louis David depicting his sister-in-law Madam SÃ©rizat. Painted shortly after his release from Robespierre's prisons following the French Revolution,  this masterwork is renowned for its effortless depiction of the subject's humanity,  portraying Madam SÃ©rizat holding a bouquet in one hand and her child's hand in the other. Its use of soft,  warm color,  as well as subtle touches of exquisite detail on the subject's hands and face,  work together to evoke emotional depth and authenticity that transcend mere photorealism- beneath the surface,  this painting truly breathes. What a delight,  therefore,  that Parfums MDCI has taken its subject to heart,  delivering a fragrance that also glows with abundant humanity and warmth. Despite a complex notes list of citrus,  fine florals,  and rich woods,  resins,  and musks,  L'AimÃ©e turns out to be a fragrance of exquisitely blended softness and light. In a sense,  it feels classical in its romantic depth,  but it surprisingly carries none of the room-filling ostentatiousness one might expect from the notes- there are no sharp edges,  no operatic swells and transitions- instead,  it's the lush romance of a perfectly tuned chamber orchestra. Florals and woods all float on a cloud of pillow-soft musk and vanilla,  aglow with the natural light of sweet fruit and the gentlest touch of castoreum. The result is a fragrance for romantics of all ages,  youthful enough for a princess,  elegant enough for a queen. Though for Monsieur David's sake,  we should point out one needn't support the monarchy to enjoy it."," Bergamot, mandarin, blackcurrant, Bulgarian rose, Egyptian jasmine, Indian champaca, lily-of-the-valley, orange flower, heliotrope, orris, raspberry, peach, cedar, vetiver, patchouli, Haitian amyris, oakmoss, sandalwood, benzoin, styrax, tonka, vanilla, amber, ambrette, white musks, castoreum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36527.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot

Coup de Foudre Eau de Parfum,Bortnikoff," Coup de Foudre certainly earns its lightning-inspired name in the opening burst, a brightly colored flash of juicy, sweet citrus and fresh, younger florals. Indeed, the combination of fresh bergamot, bitter grapefruit and sweet orange atop sunny champaca and lush jasmine is a spectacular bouquet unto itself, the kind of gorgeous natural blend that makes you look to the skies as surely as an incandescent streak of electricity across the horizon. But Coup de Foudre is both lightning and thunder, following the arresting energy of its opening with an equally masterful floral heart that resonates with deeply romantic substance. Creamy and buttery, it's filled with sandalwood and even richer cocktail of florals such as rose, carnation, tuberose, ylang-ylang, and lily of the valley. The base, then, is the ominous stillness after the thunder, dark and heavy, yet witah a surprisingly light and gentle feel to it. Slightly smoky guaiac wood, resinous labdanum, balsam tolu oil and rich vanilla are sprinkled with a touch of spicy notes from turmeric and cinnamon. Evocative, romantic, and luxurious, Coup de Foudre isn't just lightning in a bottle- it's the whole storm."," Bergamot, Lemon, Sweet Orange, White Grapefruit, Green Tea, Black Pepper, Jasmine, Rose de Mai, Lily-of-the-valley, Champaca, Ylang-Ylang, Tuberose, Cinnamon, Turmeric, Tonka Bean, Vanilla, Benzoin, Labdanum, Tolu Balsam, Pine, Guaiac Wood, Sandalwood with Pink Lotus infusion, Oud from Trat",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/804020.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Vesna Cologne Eau de Parfum,Bortnikoff," While any scent can introduce unexpected ingredients to a traditional formula, we have a special affection for those that do so with artistic purpose. Vesna Cologne is just such a fragrance, a sweet, fresh, completely wearable homage to classic eaux de cologne with a wonderfully non-traditional list of notes daringly repurposed to create the illusion of a classic citrus EDC. The sunshine of fresh lemon oil is still front and center, but in place of the spicy greenness of petitgrain, we're treated to an alluring decoction of smoothly smoky black tea and piquant tomato leaf, sweetened with a gloriously bright pineapple. Smooth, refreshing magnolia dominates the heart to provide all the water this ""eau"" might need, while a richly woody cypriol (nagarmotha) note in the base feels spicy, robust, and earthy against a sweet, almost boozy dried fruit accord. It's a wonderful olfactory illusion, a feat of scent engineering- at first sniff, a comfortable classic; upon further experience, an ingeniously unique fragrance to explore and savor."," Lemon, Black Tea, Tomato Leaf, Pineapple, Magnolia, Dried Fruits Extrait, Nagarmotha",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/804021.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, lemon
Moss Cologne Eau de Parfum,Bortnikoff," As prolific of a creator as Dmitri Bortnikoff can be, he deserves equal credit for knowing when not to get in the way of his own exceptional ingredients. Moss Cologne is a perfect example- a showcase of gorgeous natural oakmoss absolute and its resin extracts that proudly exhibits oakmoss in all of its natural beauty, too rarely experienced in modern fragrance. Every other aspect of the scent, from the bright, invigorating citrus of the opening notes to the luxuriously smooth floral heart to the rich, robust base of balsamic woods, all exist to promote the vibrantly fresh, green, earthy character of the oakmoss and show how why it has been one of the most treasured base materials in the history of perfume. Here, it brightens and smooths citrus, adds lush and natural facets to florals, and makes the base feel simultaneously more rugged and refined. In short, it makes every aspect of the scent more complex and compelling while also making it work more effectively with every other aspect- a true miracle note. Effortlessly rich, delightfully sensual, Moss Cologne is the kind of straightforwardly elegant scent that only Bortnikoff seems to know how to make these days. We're hooked."," Bergamot, Lemon, Sweet Orange, Grapefruit, Oakmoss Absolute, Violet Leaf, Jasmine, Champaca, Ylang-Ylang, Nutmeg, Oakmoss Resinoid, Ambergris, Atlas Cedar, Virginian Cedar, Labdanum, Tonka Bean, Vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/804022.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot

Seeking an escape from cloyingly sweet vanilla gourmand scents, perfumer AliÃ©nor Massenet here delivers something brighter, bolder, and altogether more invigorating, marrying the sumptuous richness of pure Madagascar vanilla with the bracing energy of a salty, iodine-laced breeze of open ocean. The sun's cheerful brightness is represented here with fresh, clean bergamot, while sweetness comes not from sugar, but instead from gorgeously yellow immortelle flower set against supporting notes of benzoin and tolu balsam, which impart subtle depth against the exquisite vanilla base. It's the kind of relaxed, upbeat elegance that L'Artisan is known for- an everyday vanilla of rare distinction."," Bergamot, immortelle, salty notes, Madagascar vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/152300.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot

New York 5th Avenue Eau de Parfum,Fragrance du Bois," It's not easy to capture one of the most diverse, evolving and breathtaking cities in the world in one single fragrance- so Fragrance du Bois decided to make two instead, one each for the disparate but equally enchanting NYC summers and winters.

Sedley Eau de Parfum,Parfums de Marly," A fragrance of unparalleled freshness and deceptive complexity, Sedley is a dynamically bright men's fragrance for those who know the power of confident subtlety. While it doesn't enter the room in front of you the way many of Parfums de Marly's powerhouse classics do, its bright, light aromatic citrus opening steadily develops on the skin into a beguiling woodsy masculine that hits its stride just as you hit yours. But first, a bit more about that opening- a hesperidic trio of mandarin, grapefruit, and lemon that combines the best of all three- tart, bright, juicy, and sharp, with the herbaceous, aromatic zing of mint and rosemary. Sedley's development is impressively judicious- the top notes linger well past a normal opening, and the classic gentleman's heart of lavender and geranium comes on so gradually that you may find yourself seduced by your own fragrance. And with that same deliberation, a warm, smooth, powerful base of musky woods emerges that hums on the skin with potent energy. It's often said that real men speak softly and let their actions do the talking. If that's you, Sedley is your fragrance."," Mandarin, grapefruit, lemon, mint, rosemary, geranium, lavender, olibanum, sandalwood, cedar, vetiver, patchouli, cashmeran, ambroxan",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70033.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, mandarin
Spicematic Eau de Parfum,"Pierre Guillaume Paris, Parfumerie Generale"," The joy of Pierre Guillaume's ""flanker"" scents is that they're anything but retreads of their original inspiration- instead they have the iterative energy of a maestro composing variations on a theme, using the constraints of a single concept to focus his energy on the serendipitous. In Spicematic 11.2, Guillaume revisits the ""aromatic-spice"" nexus that gave us the desert lemon mint and allspice of Harmatan Noir and the sub-tropical peppermint and cardamom of Indian Wood, but here, our inspiration is the cold, mineralic beauty of marble, represented in saffron, fresh ginger, and green mint. With a molecular distillation of incense adding an intense coolness, the fragrance shines and sparkles, tempered only by the organic vibration of red cedar and the resinous heat of Siberian pine. Pierre Guillaume describes Spicematic as ""marble water."" Who are we to disagree?"," Saffron, ginger, mint, incense, red cedar, pine",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/34557.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, saffron
Meet Me On The Corner Eau de Parfum,4160 Tuesdays," Meet Me On The Corner is a fragrance inspired by the 1970s but updated by about a half century. It's named after the Lindisfarne song, and captures the days when a date was just two people showing up to the same place at the same time- no texts, no swiping right, no GPS. It takes a staple of the '70s- the citrus chypre- and supplements the carefree excitement of the classic style with a serious dose of 2020 sophistication. The key to Meet Me On The Corner is three essential oils: mandora- a hybrid citrus born of sweet orange and mandarin, grown in Cyprus- plus magnolia flower, and magnolia leaf. Mandora gives the lemon and mandarin topnote a bright new sunshiny feeling. Using magnolia instead of the traditional tuberose and rosewood brings softness to the romantic heart of the scent. And in the base, all the hallmarks of a timeless chypre- moss, patchouli and styrax blended and matured in bergamot, surrounded by gentle musks. Think of this 1970-meets-2020 concept as a new Mini Cooper- all the fun of driving the original... now with working brakes and windshield wipers."," Lemon, mandarin, mandora, clementine, magnolia flowers, magnolia leaves, sandalwood, bergamot, oakmoss, musks, styrax, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64626.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, lemon
Aseel Attar / Perfume Oil,Fragrance du Bois," From the Arabic word for ""original, "" Aseel is a potently spicy,  yet delightfully fresh attar creation that more than lives up to its name. Featuring rich,  traditional accords well known on the Arabian peninsula such as cardamom and oud oil,  it represents both the origins of Arab culture,  while also feeling vibrantly new. Aseel opens with an electric current of ginger and cardamom amplified with the citrussy freshness of bergamot. The rich,  lively spice theme continues in the heart with coriander and nutmeg,  both in service of a stunning geranium note- fresh,  rich,  and rosy. And finally,  in the true spirit of an attar,  a potent and extremely long lasting base of two separate oud accords- Thai and Indian- which blend with smooth musk and cedarwood to create a sumptuous and sensual tapestry. Lush and layered enough to satisfy any attar lover,  yet fresh enough to wear any day,  Aseel is a standout."," Ginger, Cardamom, Bergamot, Coriander, Nutmeg, Geranium, Trat Oud Oil, White Musk, Indian Oud oil, Cedar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/757031.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, ginger

Anatolia Parfum,PRIN," The bridge between continents, Anatolia was a nexus for the conflicting tides of humanity- a centerpoint of economic, cultural, and even genetic exchange. Anatolia the fragrance celebrates this diversity in a sweeping oriental gourmand that incorporates a multitude of unique materials that might have passed across the plateau in ancient times- the earthy richness of dried fruits made sweet with the historic confections of loukhoum and honey, contrasted against the fiery spice of cumin and cinnamon and the spiritual brightness of incense smoke. Underneath it all, the supple, road-worn leather of the travelers and merchants who brought these treasures back and forth across the silk road, creating new cultures that endure until this day. Lovers of semi-gourmande leather, you won't want to miss this one."," Leather, date, apple, oud, cinnamon, cumin, patchouli, amber, incense, loukhoum, cacao powder, honey, suede",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/847001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, leather
Oud Sinharaja Extrait de Parfum,Bortnikoff," Oud Sinharaja is a unique, one of a kind fragrance harnessing the beauty of the essential oil of wild oud from Sri Lanka. This oil is distilled personally by perfumer Dmitry Bortnikoff and is therefore a truly special and inimitable ingredient.This spectacular evocation of the Sinharaja rainforest in Sri Lanka will inspire and enliven you with its ethereal beauty and seductive complexity. Oud Sinharaja is a tribute to the exotic delights of the fruits, flowers and plants of this exotic wonderland and the enigmatic mystery of oud.Zesty bergamot and pink grapefruit provide a bright and invigorating opening, perfectly complimented by the smooth spiciness of cardamom. The floral heart of the scent comprises luscious frangipani, exquisite magnolia and the timeless beauty of jasmine sambac. In the base of the perfume, crisp cedar wood blends with resinous labdanum and the magical aroma of wild oud from Sri Lanka.The scent has a fresh and airy quality which is instantly appealing and which belies the complexity of the many accords which have been masterfully blended to produce it. The juicy citrus and breezy floral tones make this a perfect scent for any occasion. The rare and exotic oud at the base of the scent provides a rich and exotic counterpoint which works in perfect harmony, complimenting but never overpowering the other notes."," Bergamot, Pink Grapefruit, Cardamom, Frangipani, Magnolia, Jasmine Sambac, Essential oil of Wild Oud from Sri Lanka, Atlas Cedar, Labdanum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/804017.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot

Salam Eau de Parfum,ANFAS," Salam is a fragrance of serendipitous romance- a gorgeously vivid celebration of chance encounters that lead to love at first sight.

20 20 Eau de Parfum,J.F. Schwarzlose," Berlin, 1920: the global excess of the Roaring Twenties is in full swing. Artists, authors, and youthful revelers delight in the same glamorous parties, social and gender liberation, and hedonistic exuberance capturing the imaginations of New York, London, and Paris. And in the midst of this paradigm-shattering festivity, there was a singular fragrance- CHIC, from J.F. Schwarzlose & SÃ¶hne, a must-have accessory for the fashionable German ""new woman."" 100 years later, as we face a Roaring Twenties of our own, J.F. Schwarzlose has resurrected the spirit of CHIC with 20|20, using detailed analysis of vintage bottles and records to reconstruct and reinvent the historic fragrance as a glamorous and dynamic scent for our own wild times. 2020 is a celebration of craftsmanship and creativity, a romantic tableau where the rich indulgence of pure patchouli meets the cool, velvety freshness of rose essence and bourbon geranium, enveloped in the warmth of sumptuous woody amber notes. The result is vintage floral elegance buoyed by a modern, irreverent buzz of woodsy energy- a fragrance both timeless and contemporary, with an indomitable spirit of creative expression and joie de vivre. It's impossible to say what the next decade may hold, but with 20|20, we can at least ring in the '20s in style."," Rose, benzoin, patchouli, amber woods, pink pepper, geranium",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76909.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, rose
Angelys Pear Eau de Toilette,PARFUMS DE NICOLAI," For Patricia de Nicolai, nature is the ultimate inspiration. And few fragrances are quite as regal, as inspiring, as downright mouthwatering as the pear. Since its introduction to Europe from Asia during Roman times, this uniquely complex fruit has been treasured, considered a ""fruit of the castle"" and a sign of high social distinction. It's this inspiration, specifically as it relates to the Loire Valley of France, where both delicious pears and great castles abound, that serves as the focus of Angelys Pear, named for both the Loire city of Angers, and the lys, the symbolic flower of French kings.And the scent itself? A divinely sweet and juicy pear note, enhanced by a bouquet of rose and jasmine, highlighted by invigorating oakmoss that suggests a hint of a classical chypre. Ephemeral and serene, full of purity, light, and calm, this eau de toilette perfectly illustrates the fabled bounty of the Loire Valley."," Bergamot, lemon, cut grass, blackcurrant, pear, jasmine, rose, patchouli, oakmoss, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/313061.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Ligno Extrait de Parfum,Jeroboam," When the devilish patchouli meets the pheromonal grey amber... the result is beyond a perfume, it becomes an alchemists' potion with an aphrodisiacal promise. In Vanina Muracciole's creation, Ligno is a woody extract with Amber at its heart, wrapped by the signature enigmatic musks that gives an unapparelled volume to each Jeroboam perfume."," Bergamot, Sage, Saffron, Cistus , Grey Amber, Fir Balsam, Rose Essence, Tonka Bean, Patchouli, Enigmatic Musks",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/714011.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Lumberjack Cologne Eau de Parfum,Strangers Parfumerie," Lumberjack Cologne smells exactly as advertized  a bright, herbal eau de cologne-style scent built around the invigorating scent of freshly-felled lumber! Prin pegs the inspiration for this scent as the scent rising from the dampened shirt of a North American lumberjack after a long morning cutting timber. As he mops his sweaty brow, we lean in and inhale the clean, healthy smell of warm skin, sawdust from the great redwoods he has been touching, and the gasoline smell of his saw and other tools. There is a flash of bitter citrus and Scandinavian herbs in the opening, making us think of the simple but timeless eau de cologne such a man might have applied early on that morning before heading to the forest. Lumberjack Cologne just smells great  a spacious, airy woody scent teeming with the aromatic aroma of tree sap, citrus, herbs, fresh air, clean skin, and cut wood. Nothing more, nothing less. Sometimes it makes sense not to over-think the kind of ripped-from-nature smell that makes us happy. And that is what Lumberjack Cologne is."," lemon, bergamot, grapefruit, mandarin, orris butter, guaiacwood, motor oil, soap, cedar, oak, sycamore, leather, moss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/842007.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, lemon
Ma Nishtana Extrait de Parfum,Parfum Prissana," Ma Nishtana are the first two words in a phrase meaning ""Why is tonight different from all other nights?"", taken from the stories and lyrics of Had Gadya (the Chava Alberstein version). In a way, it makes sense to turn this philosophical question on its head and ask,why is this incense scent different from all other incense scents?. After all, incense is a crowded genre and it really takes something special to stand out. Well, Ma Nishtana is something special.Standing somewhere between the soaring ethereality of Comme des Garcons' Avignon and the spiced, human weirdness of Grimoire by Anatole LeBreton, Ma Nishtana is unusual for its refusal to commit to either coolness or warmth. Instead, it is both, all at once. Its opening of smoky myrrh exploding in a cloud of fizzy aldehydes feels cooling, but immediately a bold dose of saffron, nutmeg, black pepper, cumin, and cardamom, burning through a cloud of ash and smoke turns, up the heat. There is incense  mixed incense resins rather than any single one  smoldering on a near-by censor, creating an aura of Buddhist temple'-like mysticism. But there is also the spicy warmth of thickly-fruited tea breads and pain d'epices percolating beneath, filling out the hollows. Austerity balanced by comfort. If you're on an incense quest, then Ma Nishtana might just be your final destination."," saffron, amber, aldehyde, frankincense, myrrh, styrax, rose, nutmeg, pink pepper, caraway, black pepper, cardamom, cumin, labdanum, castoreum, sandalwood, patchouli, smoke, leather, Norlimbanol, clove, allspice",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/843001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, saffron
Thichila Eau de Parfum,Parfum Prissana," Thichila is a stunning floriental incense scent, composed in the Eastern style, that will keep you guessing as to whether it is a floral oud, or an oudy floral, or a luscious floral bouquet awash in exotic Thai herbs and spices. Either way, this scent presents an ever-changing picture, like a landscape of red and gold sands shifting in a sandstorm.  The composition of Thichila is a marvel. Although at its core, the scent revolves around a hefty dose of animalic Thai oud dressed up with the minty, camphoraceous freshness of Wan Sao Lhong - a traditional Thai plant that looks like a flower but smells like a herb - Thichila fools us all at first by exploding onto the skin as a bombastic floral. An unctuous combo of champaca flower and Indian tuberose, tangled up in spicy saffron and tangy kaffir lime, creates the phantasm of a jungly ylang ylang. But blink, and before you know it, the floral sweetness is being reined in by a dark and earthy myrrh and roughed up by the leathery funk of that Siam oud. In Thai folklore, Wan Sao Lhong is feted as a love potion. And while Thichila could be a little challenging for oud beginners, one sniff and you will be enchanted  drunk on this Thai love potion."," saffron, borneol, kaffir lime, jasmine sambac, champaca, gardenia, Indian tuberose, myrrh, incense, amber, styrax, rose, turmeric, spikenard, nutmeg, civet, Thai oud, Mysore sandalwood, Indonesian vetiver, cinnamon bark, Wan Sao Lhong ( Amomum Biflorum Jack)",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/843002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, saffron
Tom Yum Eau de Parfum,Parfum Prissana," Oh boy  just say the word Tom Yum and our mouths water. And the perfume Tom Yum has precisely the same effect. Spritz it on and your senses are instantly afire. Inspired by the famously sweet and sour Tom Yum soup of Thailand, Tom Yum (the scent) belongs to Prissana's Thammachatr (Thai for natural) series, meaning that it is all natural  more a recipe than a formula, almost. An extra inducement to lick your own skin when you're wearing it.Tom Yum smells immediately like a steaming hot bowl of Tom Yum. Exploding with bright, citrusy lemongrass and coriander flavors, it is a perfect balance of hot, sweet, sour, and herbal. The flavors seem to go 1,000 leagues deep in each direction. The gingery heat of galangal is cooled by the soapy, lemony grassiness of coriander for a sensory experience that feels invigorating and exciting. Keeping all these explosive herbal and citrus notes in check is a backing of nutty, smoky chalood bark, and a soft sigh's worth of jasmine. Wonderful for a hot summer's day, when a dramatic twist on the traditional eau de cologne-style refreshment is called for.Made with 100% natural materials"," Lime, kaffir lime leaf, lemongrass, petitgrain, jasmine absolute, galangal, coriander, patchouli, grapefruit, lemon, chalood bark",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/843005.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, lime
If by RK Eau de Parfum,Frapin," ""If you can keep your head when all about you/ Are losing theirs and blaming it on you...""So begins Rudyard Kipling's legendary poem, which, for all the striking and undeniable faults of the author, has endured to become a paean to lives lived with clear eyes and gusto, lives where, to paraphrase Kipling, Triumph and Disaster are two imposters to be treated just the same. Inspired by his grandfather's spirited retelling of the poem, Frapin artistic director David Frossard was traveling south down the Indian coast when he was struck with the desire to create a scent dedicated to travel, adventure, self-discovery, and constant personal improvement. The scent itself is a dashingly spicy masculine that whisks us across the subcontinent with fiery pepper from Karnataka igniting a heady dose of ginger and cinnamon, before balancing it out with a cool, milky fig. At the intersection of spicy and creamy is the main ingredient, precious sandalwood from Mysore, the finest in the world, which finds robust partners in a base of Indonesian patchouli, Peruvian guaiac, and Venezuelan tonka- a rich, smooth, powerful combination for any man ready to seize his destiny. Make no mistake- Kipling himself was not, by any means, a role model. But If by RK transcends the flaws of the man to capture the core of why his words have remained so firmly etched in the public consciousness for all these years."," Ginger, pepper, bergamot, fig milk, cinnamon, cashmere wood, sandalwood, patchouli, guaiac, tonka bean",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/22620.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, ginger
Musc Moschus Eau De Parfum,Rania J.," What makes a perfect winter musk scent? For us, it's a fragrance that can balance the deep, sensual aspects of musk with its fresher, brighter aspects to create something both comforting and stylish- in other words, a scent that wears as well on a bright, clear winter morning as it does in the middle of a blizzard. And Musc Moschus nails this balancing act perfectly- warm yet bright, sweet yet gentle, it's the kind of effortlessly beautiful musk scent that can take the edge off the chilliest day, but won't overwhelm even when you're right next to the fireplace. The secret is the interplay between the strong, lovely base of white musk- at once both smooth and warm- and a strikingly lovely sweet and fruity opening- tart berries and juicy blackcurrant with just the right touch of sugar to feel festive but fresh. Creamy sandalwood and vanilla enhance the richness of the musk, and a perfect touch of iris adds sophistication and depth. It's the perfect scent to carry you through family gatherings and new-year adventures alike. In fact, there's really only one drawback- like winter itself, Musc Moschus is a limited edition that won't be available once 2020 rolls around, so don't miss your opportunity to get a bottle."," Bergamot, strawberry, blackcurrant, sandalwood, iris, vanilla, cashmeran, white musks",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/75107.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Milano Cento Deodorant Stick,Milano Cento," A zesty fresh deodorant stick scented with the classically masculine Milano Cento Him fragrance, perfect for any stylish and sophisticated gent on the go. Keeps you smelling of old school refinement and freshness all day long. Inspired by the wonderfully diverse, aromatic plants of Italy, the Milano Cento Him fragrance opens with sparkling notes of lemon, bergamot and green petitgrain. Herbaceous notes of lavender and rosemary combine with the intensity of basil and clary sage, followed by rich, sensual sandalwood and patchouli. Spicy clove, cinnamon, amber and warm musks live in the memory and in the heart."," Lemon, bergamot, petitgrain, lavender, rosemary, basil, clary sage, sandalwood, patchouli, clove, cinnamon, amber, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/823002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, lemon

Bee Extrait de Parfum,Zoologist," We don't usually play favorites. We love all of our perfumes, and their creators, equally. Trust us, we really do. But when a perfume comes along that's such a unanimous hit with Luckyscent staff, then we feel obliged to mention it. Bee is just irresistible! Opening with a luscious, jellied orange and a smattering of meadow flowers, the honey accord is both extremely realistic and un-animalic  a rare feat that makes Bee a real contender for the title of the baby bear's porridge of the honey fragrance genre. Set deep in a bombastic surround system of glittering amber and incense, the quietly golden floral honey center is magnified and broadcast until it fills the room, creating an incredible sillage that trails after you like the waves made by the Titanic. Though enormously rich and deep, the honey draws upon a doughy beeswax note to muffle its sweetness, and a softly musky, woody base of sandalwood and benzoin to keep it from sliding off into honey's more animalic facets. Honey is such a difficult note to do well  and, in our opinion, Bee is an unmitigated triumph. If you love, the honeyed, ambery warmth of scents such as Botrytis (but could do without the booze and grape must), then this gorgeous scent by Zoologist could be the Bee in your bonnet (sorry)."," orange, ginger syrup, royal jelly accord, broom, heliotrope, mimosa, orange flower, benzoin, labdanum, musks, sandalwood, tonka, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76026.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, orange
Meraki Eau de Parfum,Fort & Manle," Meraki is a dark homage to one of the most infamous fragrances of all time, Shisedo's long discontinued Nombre Noir. Envisioned as the Japanese brand's breakthrough ""western fragrance"" under the direction of the legendary Serge Lutens, the scent was plagued with cost overruns, packaging complications, and ultimately a run of defective flacons that led to Shisedo pulling the plug and destroying their entire unsold stock. But a few bottles are still out there, and the osmanthus-heavy scent itself, shrouded as it is in speculation and mystery, has been praised by none other than Luca Turin as ""an epiphany"" and ""the perfect discontinued scent.""When creating Meraki, Rasei Fort certainly wasn't attempting to recreate the scent of Nombre Noir, which he owns but has never dared to open. However, based on the notes, he endeavoured to create a vintage-inspired white floral heavily based around the delicate Osmanthus flower that is somewhat synonymous with the original. It's a tribute to what Nombre Noir represents- the passion and sacrifices made by perfumers and their unrelenting fervour to create fragrances that are individualistic and unique.And so this is the journey to Meraki, a gorgeous, sumptuous blend of sparkling aldehydes, mouthwatering fruit, and delicately lush, exquisite florals. Equal parts vintage and couture in that inimitable Fort & Manle house style, it's a scent both ravishingly seductive and disarmingly wearable, a creation all its own but with its compelling influences on its sleeve. It's a perfect Rasei Fort creation, in other words. And given its extremely limited availability- only 300 bottles (packaged in exquisite wooden boxes) available worldwide, ever- we think it's a worthy successor to Nombre Noir in every way."," Aldehydes, bergamot, apricot, ambergris, peach, coriander, rose, osmanthus, honey, jasmine, cedarwood, musk, sandalwood, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/78120.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, aldehydes
Lust in Paradise X Reine Paradis Eau de Parfum,Ex Nihilo," Lust in Paradise X Reine Paradis is the result of a special collaboration between Ex Nihilo Paris and the French-born visual artist Reine Paradis, who creates narrative photographs and paintings staging herself as the central figure in a transcendent landscape. Reine's work is characterized by abstract swatches of sea blues, greens, and lush tropical colors that plunge the viewer into a semi dream-like state  and this aesthetic has spilled over wholesale into Reine's gorgeous edit' of Lust in Paradise.Thus, if the original Lust in Paradise is a voyage to the French Riviera by way of a blissful dream, Lust in Paradise X Reine Paradis is a journey to California by way of a Gaugin-esque painting of Tahiti. The original scent's pretty white peony and dewy, fruity lychee gains a new solar dimension by way of the addition of salty, woody ambergris note that creates the impression of sun-warmed skin. Giving the fruit, pink pepper, and pretty florals of the original an expansive, glittering radiance, the ambergris slowly melts down into a sultry woody base that  thanks to the woody-spicy molecule known as Georgywood  adds an even more substantial depth to the original's musky basenotes. Just as pretty and sparkling as the original, Lust in Paradise X Reine Paradis adds a special something that makes us dream of far-off islands, hypnotic seascapes, sun-drenched skin, and the laid-back feel of Californian artist colonies in California."," pink pepper, white peony, lychee, solar accord, white cedarwood, musk, amber, Georgywood, ambergris accord",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/720057.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, pink pepper
Copper Eau de Parfum,Comme des Garcons," Fiery red metal, yet cool to the touch. The clarity of contrast. The newest from CDG is a provocative olfactive exploration of perceived differences and harmonious alignment built around another everyday material worthy of re-evaluation: copper. In their inimitable, iconoclastic style, the specifics of copper- the shine, the pliability, the literal electricity- are captured with unique notes- luminous pink pepper berries and juicy blackcurrant settle atop intensely green galbanum and sharp violet leaf, fiery ginger and warm, sweet tobacco clash delightfully against a metallic accord, which itself settles in next to warm, resinous myrrh and smooth vanilla. Is this a photo-perfect capture of the actual smell of copper? Why would it be? Rather, this is the soul of copper, cool but conductive, presented for those with the distinctive style to resonate at the same frequency. Another modern masterpiece from Comme des Garcons."," Pink pepper, galbanum, blackcurrant, ginger, violet leaf, tobacco, metallic notes, amber, vanilla, myrrh",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/216001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, pink pepper
Atlas Fever Eau de Parfum,Ex Nihilo," Inspired by the intoxicatingly woody, incensey scent of the greatest vintage rosewood guitars in history, Atlas Fever combines French niche perfumery know-how with the devil-may-care spirit of rebellion that defines rock n' roll. Its name  a clever twist on the name of its key raw material, Atlas Cedar  is a clue: this scent is not a collection of plain, inert wood but a scent buzzing with a sense of frenetic, barely-contained energy. The opening is fiery and smoldering, a tinder-box cedarwood charged and shot into the air with a burst of hot pink pepper and incense. Incredibly radiant, the oaky tones of the cedar and the smoky-bitter nuances of the gaiac accord billow around the wearer in a thick, spicy brown cloud for a while, before mellowing out into an incredibly lush, creamy surround sound system of real sandalwood, almondy tonka bean, and earthy black vanilla pod. If you love the potently-balsamic, ambery-woody orientals of recent years such as Armani PrivÃ© Myrrhe ImpÃ©riale or Guerlain's Songe d'un Bois en EtÃ©, then you'll love Atlas Fever. Wearing this, there's no doubt you'll make an impression, even surrounded by hundreds of other people at a rock concert."," Pink pepper, incense, narcissus, cedarwood, sandalwood, tonka bean, vanilla, woody accord (gaiac, oakwood)",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/72055.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, pink pepper
Re-Charge Black Pepper Deodorant Stick,Molton Brown," A spicy, luxurious deodorant stick blended with oakmoss and vetiver to keep the most active gentlemen dry and freshly scented all day long.  Aromas of black pepper, ginger and coriander leave the skin subtly scented with their classic fragrance for long-lasting freshness  an invigorating way to start the day."," black pepper, lemon and ginger, coriander, basil and violet leaf, vetiver, oakmoss and ambergris",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/765129.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, black pepper
Le Pavillon d'Or Eau de Parfum,Dusita," Le Pavillon D'Or by Parfums Dusita was inspired by three different lakes that bear special meaning for Thai-born perfumer, Pissara Umavijani. First and foremost, it draws on the Sun Moon lake in Taiwan, where her father, the poet Montri Umavijani (1941-2006), wroteA Wish, a poem that reads:Will I ever have a chance/to sleep by the River of Love/look on the mountain of Long Life/and dip my vision in Sun Moon Lake/to be able to live more happily/in just any confinement. But Pissara was also inspired by her love for GuerlÃ©dan Lake in Brittany, a place where she has vacationed in utter tranquility and quiet, as well as the Aisawan Triphya-Art pavilion in Thailand, a stupendous piece of Thai architecture that seems to float weightlessly several feet over the waters of the palace lake. Regardless of geography, however, it is the sense of calm, emotive beauty common to all lakes that pervades the bones of Le Pavillon d'Or. Le Pavillon d'Or is constructed as intricately as a Thai floating pavilion itself. Opening with the crisp, green chill of orris root and mint, the perfume feels immediately cooling; a hot brow soothed by splashes from a mountain stream. The peppery, citrusy nuances of the wild mentha citrata give the opening a fresh, almost classical feel. Soon after, an astonishing fig leaf accord moves into place, managing somehow to be both juicy and dry at the same time. Notes of sweet honeysuckle, boronia, white thyme, and Somalian frankincense render the fig leaf far more interesting than it oughtta be, with tendrils of sweet florals, smoky, and resinous herbal accents creating a heady-but-light whorl of scent. Underneath this all, a divine sandalwood dressed up with a complex, 30-note heliotrope accord give the scent a luxuriantly creamy, almondy base to bed it all down. Both aromatic and warm, Le Pavillon d'Or is a clever series of contrasts wrapped up in a bottle. We think it's as delicately beautiful as the trio of lakes that inspired it."," Mint, honeysuckle, orris, boronia, thyme, olibanum, heliotrope, fig leaf, oak, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/74608.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, mint
Les Annees 25 Bis Eau de Parfum,Tauer Perfumes," Les Annees 25 Bis is an exuberant throwback to what Andy Tauer refers to as the golden age of perfumery- 1920's Europe. During the so-called ""Anees Folles"", jazz music blossomed, the flapper redefined the modern woman, and Art Deco peaked- and every bit of that stylish, sexy, iconoclastic energy is captured in Les Annees 25 Bis, a fragrance in grand style, uncompromisingly vintage chic, and yet alluringly modern.Les Annees 25 Bis opens with a fresh citrus and fruit blast, combining the blinding brightness of bergamot and lemon with a mouthwatering peach accord and the intoxicating syrupiness of sweet orange oil. A glamorous heart finds lush natural rose absolute and ylang-ylang essential oil meeting a vibrant iris root, whose earthy depth steers the scent back into unisex territory. It also prepares the ground for a complex, luxurious base- benzoin, patchouli, sandalwood, ambergris, musks, and vanilla which melt together into a rich, exquisite, and long-lasting skin scent that boasts a vintage purr but a modern panache."," Bergamot, lemon, orange, peach, rose, iris, ylang, benzoin, vetiver, patchouli, ambergris",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/31470.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Zdravetz Eau de Parfum,Bruno Fazzolari," Woody, spicy, and herbaceous, the zdravetz herb which grows wild in Bulgaria has a reputation as a potent medicine- the word itself literally means ""health"" in Bulgarian. So we're not quite revealing a big secret to let you know that Zdravetz is an invigorating delight, a collection of juicy fruits, zesty citrus, lush florals, and fresh herbs that combine to inspire a delightful, indelible vitality. Grapefruit fizzes and pops, bright green galbanum hums with natural energy, and mouthwatering passionfruit combines with lush rose to seduce and enchant. Ultimately, the titular zdravetz weaves it all together in wild, woodsy, aromatic harmony. Wholly unique but wonderfully easy to wear, Zdravetz is a fresh-scent lover's dream."," Grapefruit, bergamot, galbanum, rose, passionfruit, cedar, leather, vanilla, zdravetz herb.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/69315.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, grapefruit
Elysium Parfum Cologne,Roja Parfums," Elysium Pour Homme Parfum Cologne is the original Elysium extrait in a linen summer suit, an eau de cologne-soaked kerchief tucked into the shirt pocket. Forming part of Roja Dove's ""Parfum Cologne"" collection - a new category invented by Roja Dove to give clients the luxuriousness of an EDP concentration (between 15% and 20%) but with the freshness of an eau de cologne - Elysium Pour Homme Parfum Cologne is pure summer bliss in a bottle, bathing the wearer in a cloud of sparkling, sun-lit citrus and vetiver that lasts all day long.  The original's topsy-turvy structure of balmy musks followed by fresh fruit has been inverted here; in the Parfum Cologne iteration, the joyful opening volley of grapefruit, bergamot, and lime is followed by a scintillating vetiver that sparkles as brightly as the citrus fruits. Joined by the aromatic gin-and-tonic notes of juniper berry and lemon peel, this smells like the first (and best) sip of a cold drink on a wearyingly hot day. The fruitiness of the apple and blackcurrant heart notes is toned down slightly in the Cologne concentration, relying on a slightly drier combination of citrusy vetiver and airy musks to keep the scent buoyant. Towards the end, a balmy but decidedly light creaminess creeps in, the happy result of benzoin and vanilla mingling with the airy cloud of musks and ambergris - yet Elysium Pour Homme Parfum Cologne never loses its crisp zestiness. This Parfum Cologne edition is emphatically its own creature while retaining all the smooth luxuriousness that made the original extrait so special. If you'd like Aventus without the smoky pineapple or a more polished, rounder Bleu de Chanel, then step into the glorious Elysian Fields that is the Elysium Pour Homme Parfum Cologne experience."," lemon, bergamot, litsea cubeba, rose de mai, jasmin de Grasse, cistus, galbanum, celery seed, pink pepper, caraway, nutmeg, pepper, oakmoss, vetiver, cedarwood, cedar needles, guaiac wood, amyris, labdanum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/748052.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, lemon
Creation-E Parfum Cologne,Roja Parfums," Roja's much loved Creation-E, or Enigma as it's known over the pond, is probably the ne-plus-ultra of private men's club genre - a heady swirl of cognac, rum, cane sugar, cigar tobacco, vanilla, and gingery aromas that wraps around its wearer like an ermine cloak custom-made in one of London's Saville Row tailors. But maybe  just maybe  you can't wear an ermine cloak of a scent every day (though Roja would probably argue with us on that one). If you love the rich warmth of this spicy oriental and just don't know how to quit it, then take heart  Roja Dove has heard you. Creation-E Parfum Cologne is a much lighter, fresher take on the original eau de parfum that's perfect for both those early office meetings and stupid hot weather.  The warm booziness of cognac and rum is still there, but cast over a frame that features lighter, fresher qualities of woods, tobacco, and jasmine, you get less of that rum-and-coke' feel that's not really appropriate outside of date night or deep winter, and more of a lightly-spiced, powdered tobacco affair. You still get all the complexity of the jasmine layered with woods, spice, leather, and woods, but Creation-E Parfum Cologne is an airy genoise to the fruitcake of the original. Both iterations are gorgeous, so choose according to your own lifestyle and personality!"," bergamot, geranium, rose de mai, neroli, jasmin de Grasse, heliotrope, cardamom, ginger, pepper, patchouli, cognac, tobacco, sandalwood, benzoin, vanilla, ambergris",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/748053.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Danger Parfum Cologne,Roja Parfums," A super-complex, aromatic barbershop fougÃ¨re with a classically masculine ballast of cedarwood, patchouli, and oakmoss in the background for support, Danger Pour Homme eau de parfum is now translated into a lighter, fresher form via Roja Dove's  ""Parfum Cologne"" collection - a new category invented by Roja Dove to give clients the luxuriousness of an EDP concentration (between 15% and 20%) but with the freshness of an eau de cologne. Danger Pour Homme Parfum Cologne is as deeply aromatic and savory-herbal-soapy as its predecessor, but to our noses, the new Parfum Cologne iteration replaces much of the eau de parfum's earthy moss and patchouli basenotes with a beautifully hazy, diffuse cedarwood blown out into a radiant cloud of ambergris and musk. This alteration turns the classic, mature tailoring of the eau de parfum into something altogether younger and more sensual. Certainly, we find the combination of the tart aromatics  lavender, tarragon, and bergamot  and the creamy musks, tonka bean, and cedarwood to be surprisingly sexy. Danger Pour Homme Parfum Cologne retains the impeccable bone structure of the original but loosens the knot of its tie to expose an inviting glimpse of warm, tanned flesh."," lemon, bergamot, lavender, tarragon, lily of the valley, jasmin de Grasse, violet, rhubarb, galbanum, clove, cumin, patchouli, oakmoss, wood notes, vetiver, cedarwood, vanilla, tonka bean, leather, ambergris, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/748054.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, lemon
Scandal Parfum Cologne,Roja Parfums," If the original Scandal pour Homme eau de parfum is an aromatic fougÃ¨re on steroids (think Eau Sauvage to the nth degree), then the Parfum Cologne version is a lighter, more relaxed take. Through still incredibly masculine and classic-smelling, the additional space and air introduced into the structure allows us to smell all of the aromatic notes more clearly and separately  the spearmint smells freshly-plucked, the stalky rhubarb note more distinct, and the petitgrain even more searingly bitter. The original extrait's coumarin-rich finish has been lightened in the Parfum Cologne iteration so that the herbal tarragon and moss notes get to sing out their forest-green song for much longer, and we notice that the drydown is also fresher, with the sweeter tonka and labdanum notes dialed back in favor of the salty ambergris and radiant musks.  But make no bones about it  the brighter cologne'-like freshness does not mean a drop in performance metrics. Operating at an eau de parfum concentration of 20%, Scandal pour Homme Parfum Cologne is still a rich, solidly classical fougÃ¨re that will keep you smelling like a Belgravia Square gentleman through to the end of the day. If you love the minty, herbal freshness of traditional barbershop scents and deplore the sweetness of modern masculines, then you'll love Scandal pour Homme Parfum Cologne's return to form."," lemon, bergamot, petitgrain, spearmint, lavender, basil, tarragon, lily of the valley, rose de mai, jasmin de Grasse, violet, rhubarb, cardamom, clove, nutmeg, moss, patchouli, vetiver, cedarwood, casmir wood, sandalwood, tonka bean, labdanum, ambergris, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/748055.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, lemon
Vetiver Parfum Cologne,Roja Parfums," With its new iteration as a Parfum Cologne - a new category invented by Roja Dove to give clients the luxuriousness of an EDP concentration (between 15% and 20%) but with the freshness of an eau de cologne  Roja once again proves that there's nothing on the market today that comes close to the sheer purity and quality of his Vetiver par excellence. Indeed, we're rather relieved to report that this iteration of Vetiver is very close in character to the genre-defining eau de parfum, especially in its focus on the bright, sparkling qualities of vetiver over its oft-times danker, rootier aspects. But Vetiver Parfum Cologne is indubitably lighter and fresher in feel. Its exquisite balance of woods, citrus, and grassy-nutty vetiver is borne aloft on a raft of expansively radiant musks and cedarwood and its lemongrass-y litsea cubeba is even more foot-forward than in the eau de parfum. Let's call it the summer-weight twin of the original, with a slightly cooler tone overall. Choose according to preference in weight, warmth, and density. Or maybe don't choose at all -  get both and have your vetiver needs covered in one neat (and impossibly elegant) package! In other words, worry not. What we love the most about Roja's vetiver  its brightness, its smooth-as-silk texture, its wholesome nuttiness, and its lack of discordant bitterness or dankness  has been transposed wholesale here into the Parfum Cologne."," lemon, bergamot, litsea cubeba, rose de mai, jasmin de Grasse, cistus, galbanum, celery seed, pink pepper, caraway, nutmeg, pepper, oakmoss, vetiver, cedarwood, cedar needles, guaiac wood, amyris, labdanum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/748056.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, lemon
Oud Maximus Autumn 19 Extrait de Parfum,Bortnikoff," What is real exoticism? This is something that you just couldn't try before. Today many people know what Oud is. But only a few know how rich and unusual can be the character of the wild Oud, fully revealed in a masterfully created blend. In Oud Maximus the concentration of Oud oils is so high that to preserve other notes, a special technique was created for mixing the Laotian, Indian and Thai Oud with four Rose oils from India, the Himalayas, Indonesia and France. The start of the fragrance is focused on the tantalizing animalistic character of the Oud from Laos, supported by Jasmine and Citruses. A voluminous accord of ambery Roses and Magnolia blossoms in the heart. The base consists of miscellaneous Oud oils, Civet and the Musk of Kabarga, which give the composition roundness and softness. This is how the precious fragrance maximally opening the heart of the wild Oud is born. No wonder, Oud Maximus is dedicated to the perfumer's son Maxim.Autumn '19 edition: New ingredient harvests and sourcing means this fragrance will not be exactly identical to the previous release. You may find the Autumn '19 edition even better..."," Bergamot, Sweet Orange, Pink Pepper, Jasmine Sambac, Cardamom, Rose de Mai, Himalayan Rose, Indian Rose, Hybrid Rose, Attar Gulab, Magnolia, Frangipani, Clove, Tonka Bean, Indian Oud, Oud Roots Trat, Oud Purple co Chang (Feel-oud), Oud from Sri Lanka (Feel-oud), Birch Tar, Tolu Balsam, Vanilla, Deer Musk, Civet",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/804004.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Vetiver Nocturne Autumn 19 Extrait de Parfum,Bortnikoff," If you think that you 100% aware of how vetiver can and should smell, you're probably wrong. This note requires a special attitude and deserves a dignified framing. Only under such conditions a vetiver composition of timeless beauty can be born. This is especially true when it comes to the precious Indian 25-year-old vetiver oil Ruh Khus, which forms the heart of VÃ©tiver Nocturne. In order to make the start of the fragrance greener, a young Ruh Khus is used: in its distillation process it passes through the copper pipes and thus acquires green color and smell. The base of the composition consists of the oils of Indonesian Sandalwood and Oud Trat, which were distilled by the perfumer himself with the use of a special infusion technique: during the distillation process wooded materials were enriched by the oils of White Champaca and Thai Jasmine. Floral notes revealed the beauty of Sandalwood oil extracted from the roots of centuries-old Sandalwood trees, which were cut down a long time ago and nowadays only their roots, which were preserved in the ground for years, are available to give us an aromatic material of the highest quality. Only the real Mysore Sandalwood, which is also generously used in the composition, can compete with it in terms of rarity and resplendence. It's hard to imagine a better framing for the Vetiver note than this.Autumn '19 edition: New ingredient harvests and sourcing means this fragrance will not be exactly identical to the previous release. You may find the Autumn '19 edition even better..."," Bergamot, neroli, frangipani, cardamom, champaca, champaca leaf, jasmine, oakmoss, vetiver, Ruh Khus, myrrh, sandal 100k, Indian sandalwood, sandal infusion (Thai jasmine & white champaca), oud trat, ambergris",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/804005.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Atomic Rose Eau de Parfum,Initio Parfums," If there's one thing Initio isn't known for, it's quiet fragrances- each release vibrates with an intense, sensual energy that's made the line an instant hit among stylish perfume lovers who want their signature scent to make a statement. Atomic Rose, their newest release, is another prime example of Initio's ability to find the harmonic balance between beauty and potency- a ravishingly sexy, invigoratingly unisex rose scent with liveliness and style to spare. Built around a ravishing duo of lush, top-quality Turkish and Bulgarian roses, Atomic Rose showcases every facet of its titular ingredient with carefully chosen supplemental notes- a juicy pop of bergamot, a spicy buzz of pink pepper, and a sumptuous blend of real florals (authentic Egyptian jasmine) and seductive floral derivatives (a potent dose of hedione) to seriously ramp up the power and sensuality. A long-lasting base of sweet, musky vanilla only deepens the effect, wrapping everything in a swoon-worthy haze. So no, Atomic Rose isn't the most naturalistic soliflore or softly-spoken feminine rose you've ever smelled- it's not meant to be. What it is, however, is rich, sexy, vivacious, and utterly unforgettable."," Bergamot, pink pepper, hedione, rose, jasmine, vanilla, ambrofix",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/802006.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Tabac Vert Eau de Toilette,Rogue Perfumery," Tabac Vert is a gentle tobacco breeze blowing in from the past, when tobacco-focused fragrance compositions were not sweetened with vanilla or tonka bean. With references to vintage Tabarome and Krizia Moods, Tabac Vert presents us with a gentlemanly vision of what tobacco can smell like when played with a subtle hand.The tobacco leaf in Tabac Vert is green and unsmoked - not yet 100% dry - and therefore has none of that ambery, dried fruit sweetness we are used to in modern tobacco scents. The main supporting character here is a dusty, spicy carnation that adds a slightly vintage feel. However, remarkably, nothing about this scent reads as dated. A peppery sandalwood and a fine dusting of subtle florals  rose and jasmine  give the tobacco-carnation heart a soft roundness that's comforting without being particularly sweet. Although the references here are all to great tobacco masculines of the past, we can't help but feel that a woman could totally rock this too."," tobacco, carnation, oakmoss, sandalwood, amber, pepper, bergamot, rose, jasmine",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/838002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, tobacco
40 Rogue Eau de Toilette,Rogue Perfumery," 40 Rogue is a recreation of the long-discontinued 40 Love by Jean Desprez, a fragrance that was apparently an interesting cross between an animalic, 1970s-style musk and a fougÃ¨re. Given the opportunity to smell a vial of this forgotten gem, Manuel Cross decided that it wassimply too good to lose to the mists of time, and so here we are!Fragrance fans not used to vintage perfume, or even vintage-style perfume, may want to adjust their television sets. 40 Rogue initially smells very vintage, with a burst of hairspray-ish aldehydes, wax-coated fruit, and a dusty carnation setting the scene in a pre-war diner in Paris, its spine straight and hair coiffed to an inch of its life. But this rich, formal air relaxes quickly, loosening its stays to let in gusts of aromatic, sunburnt herbs, lemon, and creamy, animalic musks that recall a fresher Jicky or even a jazzed-up Jovan's Musk (original 1970s formula). Fuzzy fruit, moss, and hay-like narcissus folded into a barbershoppy musk  what's not to like here?"," citrus, aldehydes, fruity notes, basil, tarragon, carnation, rose, narcissus, oakmoss, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/838004.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, citrus
Derviche Eau de Toilette,Rogue Perfumery," The brief Manuel Cross set himself for Derviche was simple  honor the famously soft green, powdery vanilla of vintage Emeraude by Coty but give it the power of one of those ambers coming out of the Middle-Eastern houses. In the end, Derviche smells very little like Emeraude but somehow features the same idea, which is to say a perfect balance struck between the tartness of citrus and the creamy sweetness of amber.At heart, Derviche is really all about hookah. The tobacco accord here is incredibly rich, with dried cherry facets that will make you think of revani, a Turkish semolina cake soaked in a honey syrup so sweet it's almost sharp. Unlike Ambre NarguilÃ© by Hermes, which Derviche resembles slightly, the ambery tobacco has a little animalic kick in its tail to keep things interesting. Civet and saffron act together to form a dry, slightly funky animal leather accord, while ambergris gives the dry-down a salty-sweet muskiness that's entrancing. If you love those big, insanely comforting old school balsamic ambers or tobaccos, then give this Derviche a whirl."," bergamot, labdanum, vanilla, jasmine, olibanum, sandalwood, musk, tobacco leaf, leather, saffron, civet",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/838005.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot

Riviera Drive Eau de Parfum,Atelier des Ors," The mythical scenic drive along the coastline of the French Riviera, so vividly captured in Hitchcock's To Catch A Thief with Grace Kelly and Cary Grant, is the inspiration for Riviera Drive, a thrillingly fresh new scent from Atelier des Ors. Just as the breathtaking views of the winding Cote d'Azure roads combine sun, sea, and flora as they weave through Menton on the way to St Tropez, so do does this fragrance combine vibrant citrus, electrifying aromatics, and sexy, soothing woody notes to evoke this iconic route. Riviera Drive opens with a vibrant spritz of bright lemon and the buzz of fresh herbs, giving us a grand panorama of the coastline from sky to land. As the woodsy notes emerge, we can picture our adventure taking us through the shade of the grand parasol pine trees, before a dash of intoxicating absinthe and a soothingly spiritual patchouli find us at our destination, exhausted but fulfilled, a sparkling cocktail in hand. Exhilarating and memorable, Riviera Drive is a summer delight."," Lemon, marjoram, rosemary, cedar leaf, absinthe, patchouli, cashmeran, cedar, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/74411.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, lemon
Pomelo Riviera Eau de Parfum,Atelier des Ors," Pomelo Riviera whisks us away to the secluded garden of a villa overlooking the shimmering azure seas of the South of France. We smell an abundance of citrus trees, laden with fruits and fragrant flowers, caressed by a gentle ocean breeze. It's a vivid portrait of paradise- a moment in time we hope will never end. The unique beauty of Pomelo Riviera is the natural interplay between juicy tartness- zesty, radiant grapefruit and refreshing bergamot- and the silky smoothness of the deeply soothing floral bouquet of orange blossom, jasmine, and rose. The crystalline sparkle of the salt accord refracts the intensity of the sunlight, refining it into a radiantly seductive glow. Lively yet relaxing, Pomelo Riviera is a dynamic unisex citrus floral to celebrate the simple, memorable pleasures of a beautiful day well spent by the ocean."," Grapefruit, jasmine, bergamot, orange flower, salt accord, rose, cedarwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/74412.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, grapefruit
Riviera Lazuli Eau de Parfum,Atelier des Ors," The warmest and richest of Atelier des Ors' Riviera trilogy, Riviera Lazuli is blissful blend of tart citrus and robust wood with a slow transition into a glowingly warm incense resin that evokes an unforgettable sunset over the azure waters of the Mediterranean. The outstanding citrus notes that have defined all three scents is still here, bright, juicy and robust, with a characteristically energetic spray of saltwater, but while a complement of aromatic woods is still present and vibrant, Riviera Lazuli moves in a duskier direction, with incense and and hints of dried immortelle providing warmth and a touch of caramel-inflected spice. Balsam adds an even warmer element, evoking sun-heated driftwood and the glow of sunset on skin. It's a perfect memory at the end of a beautiful day- a scent of wholesome indulgence and pure satisfaction you won't ever forget."," Lemon, cypress, bergamot, clary sage, cedar, gaiac, immortelle, fir balsam, incense",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/74413.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, lemon
Across The Ocean Eau de Parfum,Gravel," The story of Gravel is one that connects two continents- Europe and North America- so it's only appropriate that their second scent is a tribute to the invisible ties between the two, and the luxurious overseas steamer ships of yesteryear that used to ferry people of all walks of life to and from the old country. Across The Ocean is a robust scent of smooth, deep woods, rich oud, and luxurious musk that exudes the gentlemanly sophistication of a bygone era. Citrus adds a light, bright touch to the opening notes, while tonka, musk, and vanilla soften and sweeten the richness of the woodsy base. Conceived by Joseph Knudsen as a men's scent, we find it easily wearable by anyone who enjoys potent but balanced woodsiness- the kind of scent that signifies good taste and adventurous spirit, all without shouting."," Bergamot, lemon, cashemere wood, oud, rose, tonka, gaiac, vanilla, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/829001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Terrible Teddy Eau de Parfum,Penhaligons," ""Teddy lives for the thrill of the chase, ensnaring unsuspecting hearts with his scent.""You can be forgiven if the plotlines of the Penhaligon's Portraits series have become a bit too convoluted to follow- to be honest, we're not quite sure we know what's going on at this point. Luckily, all that matters (aside from those jaw-dropping caps) is the scent, and Terrible Teddy is a robust, masculine, and surprisingly nuanced leather and incense gem. While the imposing golden rhinoceros certainly speaks to Teddy's impressive lasting power, there's refinement and subtlety at play here- the opening bursts with piquant spice, the leather is luxurious and supple, the incense delicately smoky with a perfectly metered dollop of dark woodsiness in the drydown, leavened with the warm airiness of ambroxan. With a secret weapon like this, it's no wonder Terrible Teddy has managed to ensnare so many unsuspecting hearts."," Incense, leather, ambroxan",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/441052.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, incense
Ambre Khandjar Eau de Parfum,Une Nuit Nomade," The souq of Muttrah, found in the heart of Muscat, is the perfect place to search for a legendary Khandjar dagger- the identity, pride and heritage of Oman that carries the virtues of luck and protection from evil. They say wearing a Khandjar is like carrying a piece of the Omani soul, and Ambre Khandjar is a tribute to the power of tradition. It is a powerful oriental amber, sweet and rich with syrupy plum and warm resin. Modern metallic facets and a lingering of leather and vanilla make it timeless, warm and addictive. A scent of skin tanned by the sun and the cold of metal, Ambre Khandjar is a timeless treasure worthy of its namesake."," Mandarin, Black Plum, Cistus Labdanum Aboslute, Vanilla Pod O2, Orris Absolute, Ylang Ylang, Sandalwood, Patchouli, Benzoin Resinoid",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/833000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, mandarin
Jardins de Misfah Eau de Parfum,Une Nuit Nomade," In the village of Misfah Al Abreyeen, a cornucopia of pomegranates, peaches, figs, and apricots grow abundantly in the midst of the mountain aridity, with marvelous palm trees as far as the eye can see, their branches heavy with the weight of dates. It is the bounty of legend come to life, an ingeniously engineered garden paradise created by warriors who set down their weapons to grow instead of destroy.Jardins de Misfah is a harmony of ripeness- a whisper of fresh flower petals fused with an accord of creamy dates, syrupy honey and sweet rosewater. A delicate yet deliberate dusting of exotic spices deepens the feminine sensuality, while a gently green and powdered almond provides an unconventionally smooth gourmand base. Fresh, rich, and mouthwatering all at once, Jardins de Misfah is a gorgeously wearable portrait of abundance."," Cardamom, Nutmeg, Date Accord, Rose Absolute, Rose Essence, Saffron, Almond",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/833001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, cardamom
Mr. Vetiver Eau de Parfum,Une Nuit Nomade," This is a story about a man who you may have encountered somewhere near Java. People say he is tall, with skin that has been tanned by the sun and tattooed by the passage of time. His blue gaze plunges into the viewfinder of his Leica- but who is he? An olfactory portrait of a legendary Javan photographer and gadfly, Mr. Vetiver turns out to be a fragrance both exotic and sporty, relaxed and refined- a perfect demonstration of all that vetiver can do. Opening with a buzz of fresh citrus and spice, Mr. Vetiver instantly demonstrates a comfort with the complexity of its titular ingredient, which is featured in full- earthy, grassy, sweet, clean, woodsy, and spicy, all in perfect harmony. Rich, mouthwatering cardamom sidles up smoothly beside aromatic basil and tarragon, and a unique piri-piri pepper adds a fiery touch of distinction. The results are as versatile and easy to wear as they are undeniably compelling. An elegant fragrance revealing the freshness of Vetiver in a spicy and delicate accord, Mr. Vetiver is a man-about-town you're going to want to get acquainted with."," Cardamom, Grapefruit, Lime, Basil, Tarragon, Geranium, Vetiver.

Fleur des Fleurs Eau de Parfum,Une Nuit Nomade," Bali, island of flowers. The ylang-ylang, sweet, rich, and luscious, is so highly prized for its complex fragrance and incomparable benefits for the mind and body that it means 'Flower of Flowers' in the Malay language. And jasmine is the queen of the night, patiently waiting for sunset so she can release her powerful, warm perfume into the air. Fleur des Fleurs is an ode to ylang-ylang and jasmine, an intense white floral accord with deep, romantic lushness. Freshness is provided with the crisp citric tang of grapefruit and the mouthwatering savor of saffron, while a deep, woodsy base of sandalwood and amber nourishes the soul. A tropical floral of depth and character, Fleur des Fleurs more than earns its superlative."," Bergamot, Saffron, Grapefruit, Jasmin, Ylang-Ylang, Tubereuse, Glycine, Benzoin Tears, Sandalwood, Vanilla, Amber, Oud Wood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/833004.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Memory Motel Eau de Parfum,Une Nuit Nomade," When Andy Warhol moved to Montauk, he became an anchor point, a lighthouse for an entire generation of artists. He rented his mansion for a summer to the Rolling Stones, who were rehearsing for their tour and pre-recording what would be one of their greatest albums, Black and Blue', which included the melancholy ballad Memory Motel'.This eponymous perfume is a burning tribute to those restless, turbulent times. An androgynous perfume with notes of tobacco wrapped in patchouli leaves, pierced with a touch of vanilla. Smoky, spicy, mossy, and floral, with just the slightest hint of sweetness, it feels like it could be the smell of an iconically kitschy motel hallway, faded carpet and cigarette smoke, primally comforting, with seduction, adventure, relaxation, and beautiful mundanity hidden behind each subsequent door."," Bergamot, Iris, Incense, Carnation, Mosses, Patchouli, Vanilla, Tobacco, Leather",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/833007.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Aventus Cologne Eau de Parfum,Creed," How does one go about reinventing a classic? If you're the house of Creed, you take everything that people loved about Aventus and Aventus For Her and bring it all together in a universal scent that can be enjoyed by men and women alike. Meet Aventus Cologne, a fresher, more modern complement to two iconic scents that provides an olfactive experience all its own. The woody fresh Aventus Cologne opens with bright giner, mandarin, and pink pepper, giving an invigorating unisex start that Aventus devotees should find both recognizable and novel. An earthier, deeper heart reveals notes of rich patchouli, creamy Indian sandalwood, and spicy, lightly citric vetiver. And while robust, elegantly masculine birch still sings in the long-lasting base, it's now refined with resinous styrax, and a smoothly unisex combination of musk and tonka bean which exudes graceful power. Aventus and Aventus For Her fanatics have always known there was something special at the core of their scents- now, it's all in one completely irresistible package--a new modern classic."," Ginger, mandarin, baie rose, patchouli, sandalwood, vetiver, styrax, birch, musk, tonka",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/49376.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, ginger
Baikal Leather Intense Eau de Parfum,PARFUMS DE NICOLAI," In the seemingly endless expanse of the Siberian birch forests, the majesty and power of nature can leave one with a humbling and awe-inspiring new perspective on where they fit into the hierarchy of the natural world. This breathtaking natural beauty is the inspiration for Patricia and Axel de Nicolai's newest leather scent, a robust yet velvet-soft offering that eschews the garishness of brutal, flashy leathers for the smoothness of freshly-tanned suede, placed expertly in the midst of the crisp and invigorating scents of a wild Siberian birch forest. The leather aspect of this EDP is essentially created by blending two dry, woody notes: essence of gaiac wood and essence of smoked pine. This powerful duet is revealed by a fiery start of spicy citrus with yuzu, pepper and saffron, while the aromatic touch of spearmint completes the top note. The floral heart of rose and violet envelops the leather, softened by an iris butter, tonka beans and white musk background. Robust yet refined, Baikal Leather is a leather of unusual distinction."," Yuzu, pepper, saffron, leather, birch, violet, rose, iris butter, gaiac, sandalwood, vetiver, tonka bean, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/313060.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, yuzu

Squid Extrait de Parfum,Zoologist," The vast ocean swells and contracts, caught in the relentless tug of the moon. Beneath the surface, a school of squid emerges. Strange, elastic forms propel from the deep in a frantic search for sustenance. They are not alone. Their predators lunge, only to be foiled by blinding jets of murky ink. A massive sperm whale dives, leaving a temporary peace bobbing in its wake. Lumps of ambergris, expelled by the whale and polished by the salty currents, wash ashore. Waste? Flotsam? To the perfumer, this elusive substance is nothing less than treasure.Zoologist Squid sings a song of a dark, tumultuous sea of tangy brine, the stormy air electrified with pink pepper and the elemental glow of salicylate. Crisp, smoky incense evokes an ominous twilight, while a uniquely sweet, cloudy ink accord should leave no doubt why this unforgettable scent earned its name. Finally, all is united with the moody, compellingly oceanic aroma of ambergris. Like the endless depths that inspired it, this elegant scent ripples with the mysteries of the sea."," Pink Pepper, Solar Salicylate, Incense, Black Ink Accord, Salty Accord, Opoponax, Ambergris, Benzoin, Musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/760025.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, pink pepper
Symphonie de Neroli Extrait de Parfum,Bortnikoff," While every Bortnikoff fragrance is surely a symphony- a masterful blending of the best ingredients in the world to produce something more than the sum of its parts- you might be initially surprised that Symphonie de Neroli is the one that earned the symphonie right in the title. After all, this is arguably Bortnikoff's most focused, uncomplicated-feeling scent so far, a bright, cheerful, naturalistic celebration of perfume's most beloved white floral. But one glance at the impressive notes list, and it's plain to see that this seemingly simple soliflore is as complex a creation as any- with each exquisite ingredient carefully selected to enhance the beauty of neroli in full. Bright, dynamic citrus gives intense freshness, while rich jasmine sambac supplements neroli's lush, romantic tones. Exceptional Javan and Indian vetiver alongside Virginian cedarwood coax out the woodsy and spicy elements, joining a balsam-infused oud to create a warm, glowing base that feels entirely in the spirit of neroli. Fresh, lush, spicy, romantic, rich, warm? Finally, a neroli scent that truly lets you have it all."," Bergamot, Lemon, Lime, Clementine, Neroli, Jasmine Sambac, Vetiver from Java, Vetiver from India (Ruh Khas), Ambergis, Oakmoss, Virginian Cedar, Oud from Trat, Peru Balsam, Tolu Balsam",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/804011.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Zemfira Extrait de Parfum,Bortnikoff," Zemfira is the positively delightful answer to a simple question: what if a rose-oud scent didn't take itself quite so seriously? This, of course, isn't to say that any aspect of Zemfira is less than the utmost quality- from pure Vietnamese oud oil to Europe's finest Rose de Mai to authentic Atlas cedarwood, Zemfira is undoubtedly fit for royalty. But this is a brighter, fresher, more youthful rose-oud than you've experienced before- less Queen, more Princess- with juicy bergamot, zesty pink pepper, and a blend of the aforementioned Rose de Mai with an especially fresh, young tea rose that positively sings with young energy. The oud, too, is vibrant- green, bright, and not at all barnyard funky, and blended perfectly with creamy sandalwood and stout, fresh cedar to take an often exotic and heavy pairing and reinvent it as romantic and energetic. Rose-oud lovers looking for something you've never smelled before? Make haste for Zemfira- but leave your stuffy preconceptions at the door."," Bergamot, Pink Pepper, Rose de Mai, Hybrid Tea Rose, Atlas Cedar, Bengalian Sandalwood, Vietnamese Oud",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/804012.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Instant Crush Eau de Parfum,Mancera," We all know the feeling: with a single glance your jaw drops, your knees buckle, and every last thought in your head is replaced with pure infatuation. It's this magic that Mancera has on its hands with Instant Crush, an irresistible combination of rose, jasmine, and amber that balances playful sweetness and lush sensuality in a way that anyone who's ever experienced love at first sight knows all too well. Against an opening pop of bright, juicy citrus, a fiery vein of ginger and saffron lends a dry, spicy elegance that leads seamlessly into the lush, romantic floral amber heart. The perfect proportions of sweet musk and creamy, woodsy vanilla prolong the sophistication, placing Instant Crush in the firmament of sweet, dry, spicy floral orientals that fans of classics like Baccarat Rouge 540 can't get enough of. But please, don't take our word for it- as you'd hope from a scent called Instant Crush, one sniff is likely all you'll need to turn your world upside-down."," Bergamot, mandarin, saffron, ginger, rose, jasmine, amber woods, patchouli, sandalwood, vanilla, oakmoss, white musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/649041.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Royal Sapphire Extrait de Parfum,Thameen," The Imperial State Crown and Sceptre of the United Kingdom, the most precious of the Crown Jewels, share a signature stone- the sapphire. It is the awe-inspiring beauty and resonant depth of this precious, prodigious gemstone that makes up the inspiration for Royal Sapphire, an opulent blend of fruits, florals, and ambered woods that manages to delight and enchant all at once. True to its name, Royal Sapphire opens regal and sparkling, with a stunningly perfect top note of bergamot- sparkling, bright, sophisticated- paired with sweet, juicy mandarin. This mouthwatering duo only increases in potency as a dynamic and lovely orange blossom-led white floral heart adds romantic and regal depth. As a rich amber blends with dry woods in the base, the effect is mesmerising- a fragrance lively and joyful enough to captivate lovers of fruity florals and gourmands, yet as sophisticated as the Crown Jewels themselves. In short- Royal Sapphire is a gem you simply must add to your private collection."," Bergamot, mandarin, orange blossom, jasmine, ambergris, patchouli, moss, amber, dry wood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/73422.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Kintsugi Eau de Parfum,Masque Milano," ""Cherish the simple. Cherish the old. Do not hide your scars, show them with pride.""This simple yet powerful sentiment perfectly captures the ethos behind the ancient Japanese technique of Kintsugi, or Kintsukuroi, which repairs broken pottery using gold-infused lacquer, highlighting instead of obfuscating the cracks and celebrating the beauty and strength of imperfection. With this as inspiration, Masque Milano and perfumer Vanina Muracciole delivers a ""rediscovered"" chypre, pieced back together with a golden vein of suede leather that both restores and reimagines the structure of the style. Traditional elements of bright, bracing bergamot and rich, refined patchouli remain, but oakmoss has been replaced with a salty, savory amber accord that complements the glowing suede heart with an unmistakable fine-grain shimmer. A lovely touch of femininity comes by way of fresh, elegant Grasse rose centifolia and watery magnolia, while the aforementioned patchouli- fractionally distilled to strip away the mustiest aspects- rebalances the composition to sophisticated, unisex bliss. Whether you're a chypre lover looking for a loving reinterpretation, or simply a fan of Masque Milano's elegant yet unpretentious, creator-driven fragrances, Kintsugi is every bit the sparkling treasure its name makes it out to be."," Bergamot, magnolia, amber, suede, rose, violet leaf, benzoin, raspberry leaf, patchouli, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64010.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Isfarkand Elixir Parfum,Ormonde Jayne," Isfarkand has always had a unique alchemy to its formula- on paper, it's a simple combination of citrus, cedar, and vetiver, and yet there's an abiding magic to how it wears on skin- clean, bright, modern, and transparent, each note blends into those surrounding it to create an enveloping, energizing, modern, and yet supremely easy going potion- a true ""aura"" of stylish and casual panache perfect for almost any situation. Isfarkand Elixir knows not to mess too much with a good thing, but the added Parfum strength gives us a chance to eat our cake and still have it too- while the citrus top still sparkles brightly, a more concentrated cedar note now hums with soft yet potent energy- a rebalance that adds significant longevity and a new layer of complexity in the base. All of style that made you fall in love with Isfarkand the first time, and now even more substance to match. What We Think Still very much the fresh, woodsy, modern Isfarkand we love, with much improved longevity and stronger cedar."," Lime, mandarin, bergamot, iso-e super, cedar, vetiver, moss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77757.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, lime
Ta'if Elixir Parfum,Ormonde Jayne," The Ta'if rose- greener, spicier, more vibrant than the lusher European varietals- was the perfect centerpiece to the original Ta'if EDP, where sweet spice and gentle, watery florals defined a light, elegant rose scent with a restrained touch of gourmand exoticism. In Elixir form, however, a dramatic new element emerges with the addition of precious Cambodian oudh, which introduces a rich, warm, animalic sensuality. While it'd be hard to argue that this doesn't add some heaviness to a previously lighter-than-air composition, we urge you to think of Ta'if Elixir as its own, separate fragrance- one where the oudh turns the peppery florals into something sweepingly romantic and thoroughly, three-dimensionally gorgeous. Ta'if Elixir is a scent to be worn with reckless abandon, a breathtaking perfume of tremendous presence and timeless elegance. What We Think Quite different from the airy, subtle Ta'if EDP, and miles apart from a typical rose-oud combination as well. Deep, rich, and authentically warm and animalic."," Pink pepper, saffron, dates, rose, freesia, orange blossom, jasmine, broom, amber, oudh",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77758.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, pink pepper
Ormonde Elixir Parfum,Ormonde Jayne," The signature Ormonde Man & Woman eaux de parfum are famous for a reason- featuring a distinctively seductive note of black hemlock, their spicy, aromatic sophistication was, and remains, a breath of fresh air. Now, Ormonde Jayne has taken the shared DNA of both Ormonde Man and Ormonde Woman and produced Ormonde Elixir, a truly stunning, altogether new interpretation. The famed black hemlock is back, along with aromatic cedar and rich cardamom, but in the Elixir, a warm, sensual note of exquisite Cambodian oudh finds alluring, animalic new depth. There's never been a better way to experience the signature of this stunning house. What We Think The distinctive aromatic freshness and spice of Ormonde Man and Ormonde Woman- already quite sexy!- gets an upgrade in both sensuality and sophistication with a perfect complement of warm, strong, just-the-right-amount-of-animalic oudh."," Cardamom, coriander, grass oil, black hemlock, violet, jasmine, cedar, amber, sandalwood, oudh",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77760.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, cardamom

Now, the early morning murmur of life is about to burst through in a Mediterranean melting-pot home to a thousand minarets and a thousand fragrant gems. This is the aroma of Cairo, a breathtakingly gorgeous new scent from Penhaligon's that blends exotic and modern together in a perfect tribute to a metropolis that has housed both gods and humans for untold millenia. Damascan Rose is macerated in an abundance of woods and spices.

Neroli Intense Eau de Parfum,PARFUMS DE NICOLAI," The Queen of Niche, the Queen of French Perfume- there are so many titles one could give to the astoundingly accomplished Patricia de Nicolai, but perhaps her favorite is a simple one: the Queen of Neroli. Indeed, she is an unquestioned master of every facet of the orange tree, from the soothingly fresh blossom to the bitter stem to the juicy fruit, and her mastery is entirely on display in Neroli Intense, which features every aspect of the orange tree- neroli, orange, petitgrain- in a beautifully fresh, lushly floral, utterly intoxicating fragrance. Pittosporum flower enriches the white floral elegance, while beeswax absolute and hints of patchouli and white musk add depth. If you love the classic beauty and freshness of neroli, Neroli Intense is a must try."," Neroli, mandarin, orange, tarragon, pittosporum, petitgrain, patchouli, musk, beeswax",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/313059.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, neroli
Brume du Matin Eau de Parfum,Fragrance du Bois," For a house that made its name with rich, vintage-feeling compositions and extraordinary oud, Fragrance du Bois sure does know how to make a delightful fresh scent as well. The latest example is Brume du Matin, a gorgeously delicate summer floral that truly does capture the refreshing bliss of a misty seaside morning. Brume du Matin opens with a perfect evocation of the first rays of sun piercing the marine layer, as mandarin and bergamot shine through a smooth, foglike heart of soft summer florals and juicy but deliberately unsweetened peach and plum. Peony lovers especially should swoon at the lush, playful tones of the floral bouquet, which in turn lead into a gently creamy base of soft woods, amber, and white musk that resonate comfort long after the real fog has given way to summer sunshine. Fresh, fun, and deeply soothing, Brume du Matin is simply lovely."," Mandarin, bergamot, peach, plum, rose, violet, jasmine, peony, amber, woods, white musk.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/757026.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, mandarin

Notorious Oud Eau de Parfum,D.S. and Durga," With Notorious Oud,  D.S. & Durga pay tribute to one of the greatest legends to ever emerge from their home borough of Brooklyn- Christopher Wallace,  better known as The Notorious B.I.G. But if you think the inspiration is merely surface level,  you're dead wrong- like the charming,  rough-edged,  impossibly clever rhymes of Frank White himself,  Notorious Oud showcases a versatile and often misunderstood fragrant ingredient with the type of irreverent panache that leaves competitors sputtering like the Madd Rapper. Biggie references aside,  how does Notorious Oud actually smell? Start with the oud itself,  a rich Indonesian specimen (""smell the Indonesia, "" as the great man once rapped) with a robust balance of smoky,  earthy,  and animalic tones. Afghani saffron and white galbanum enhance the green,  spicy energy,  while a lush Bulgarian rose feels as smooth and suave as Big Poppa. We could go on,  but we'll leave you instead with one last Biggie quote to capture how we feel about Notorious Oud: ""Stay far from timid/only make moves when your heart's in it/and live the phrase sky's the limit..."""," Saffron, camphor, white galbanum, oud, rose, lavender, civet, cetalox, papyrus",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/686084.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, saffron
Musk Cologne Eau de Parfum,Bortnikoff," When you have access to raw materials as exceptionally high quality as those used in Bortnikoff scents, the word ""cologne"" should never be mistaken to mean a fragrance is light or fleeting. Instead, it's an invitation to discover the tremendous amount of depth that the traditionally fresh style can contain- something we first learned with their ambergris-laden Amber Cologne. But Musk Cologne is something else altogether, an arresting combination of vibrant citrus, smooth florals, and rich, warm musk that thrums with sensual energy that simply must be experienced to be believed. Gently spicy, subtly smoky, and compellingly animalic, this is a musk note of remarkable sophistication, so striking that it upends the staid expectations for an eau-de-cologne style fragrance and reinvents it as something potent and seductive, even while maintaining a cheerful and energetic exterior. Or to put it another way- you've never smelled a cologne quite like this."," Bergamot, lemon, tangerine, sweet orange, green tea, lily of the valley, magnolia, tuberose, ylang ylang, deer musk, sandalwood, gaiac",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/804009.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Bergamotto di Calabria Eau de Parfum,Perris Monte Carlo," The oldest and most revered method for extracting Calabrian bergamot oil is performed by hand using a specially curved knife and a natural sponge. It's a painstaking process, requiring 200kg of fruit for a single litre of essential oil, and thus it is rarely employed today, but it sidesteps the quality control issues inherent in mechanical extraction to produce a fragrant essence of the most delicate, complex quality, a perfect blend of tart, juicy freshness and smooth, sophisticated floral tones. It's this uniquely exceptional bergamot that defines the character of Bergamotto di Calabria, supplemented with a fiery jolt of ban timur and pink peppers, smoothed with a delicate white floral heart, and given warm, creamy depth with a musky sandalwood base. It's the absolute best that the old ways have to offer, made exceptional with just a touch of the new."," Bergamot, petitgrain, timur pepper, pink pepper, orange flower, neroli, orange blossom, jasmine, iris, sandalwood, vetiver, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/702052.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot

Le Chant de Camargue Eau de Parfum,L'Artisan Parfumeur," The desalinated marshes of the Camargue region of France are known for the treasured ""wild"" red rice cultivated there- and the gorgeous pink flamingos drawn to the amber-colored plants. Le Chant de Camargue, the newest from L'Artisan and perfumer Alberto Morillas, captures the unique character of this magical location, delivering a subtle and beautiful fragrance  that evokes the delicately floral, subtly earthy, soothingly creamy aromas one might experience on a stroll through a real rice paddy. Using the fresh. gently smoky tones of bergamot to set the scene, Le Chant de Camargue quickly reveals a smoothly powdery heart of rice, an accord built from scratch by Morillas to capture the uniquely nutty texture of Camargue red rice. The rice's mouthwateringly milky tones are further supplemented with the sandalwood milk accord of the base, prolonging the woody and creamy elements of the rice and bringing the intensity of the still-noticeable bergamote back into play. The cumulative effect is compellingly dreamlike, delicately mouthwatering, and subtly invigorating- a true journey through a beautiful and distinctive corner of France as only L'Artisan could provide."," Bergamot, Carmargue rice, sandalwood milk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/152026.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot

As with any good dream, Petales de Cashmere has no sharp edges, each delightful note existing instead in complete harmony, the feeling of almost primal well-being lingering for hours on the skin.

A Man's Cologne Eau de Parfum,Gravel," There are fragrances that are defined by their era, and then there are fragrances that outlast their own era and become immortal. Gravel is just such a fragrance. Originally invented by Michael Knudsen in 1957, Gravel A Man's Cologne was a different sort of men's scent right from the start- sold exclusively at select boutiques and featuring a distinctive profile- fresh, fruity citrus that transitions into a never-too-heavy blend of balsamic woody notes. The base blends powdery tonka, a secret selection of spices, and a mineralic, lightly industrial aura of incense and vetiver that does indeed call to mind the name of the fragrance- and yes, those are real pieces of gravel in the bottle, perhaps imbuing their own unique character over time. The result is a scent that we'd imagine has the exact same balance of elegant classicism and sexy modernity in 2019 as it did more than half a century ago. Gravel A Man's Cologne is, by any standard, a legendary scent. Who couldn't use one of those in their life?"," Bergamot, orange, patchouli, tonka bean, benzoin, incense, vetiver, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/829000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Villa Nellcote Eau de Parfum,19-69," ""Never has a house been so closely associated with the creation of a rock album. This was a summer that would change the history of music forever. The fragrance Villa Nellcote is the embodiment of the magnificent garden and surroundings at the estate with the same name."" -Johan Bergelin Villa Nellcote, a 19th-century mansion overlooking Villefranche Bay on France's Cote d'Azur, has what could generously be called a colorful past- after serving as a Gestapo headquarters during the Nazi occupation of France, the Villa was reclaimed for ""allied"" debauchery when it was famously rented in the summer of 1971 to serve as the party palace and studio of the Rolling Stones as they recorded their classic album Exile On Main Street. Using the lushly landscaped grounds as an inspiration, Villa Nellcote the fragrance is a smooth, confident unisex floral, boasting a bouquet of lush flowers enriched with a piquant blend of fresh green citrus and spice. We picture ourselves atop the grand outdoor staircase overlooking the lavish gardens, with a subtly smoky base of black tea, patchouli and woods the only indication of the rock-star hedonism happening in the cellar-turned-studio, hidden away from prying eyes. For those who like their summertime freshness with just a hint of naughtiness, Villa Nellcote is a perfect tribute to a locale that will forever live in rock-n-roll infamy."," Grapefruit, bergamot, petitgrain, pink pepper, elemi, lemon, lemon flower, violet, rose, jasmine, magnolia, osmanthus, black tea, cabreuva, cedar, patchouli, white amber, musk, moss, gaiac",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/812008.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, grapefruit
Portrayal Woman,Amouage," The fifth chapter of the cycle of the Amouage narrative, Portrayal is a manifestation of a person's orientation to herself. A reflection of her unique authenticity, it is about breaking free from the cages of solitude society set around people because their truths are often seen as shockingly unconventional. Portrayal embodies an artist's ability to reconnect fragments from different times and places. When society is barren, they are able to transport themselves and immerse in the freedom of rebellion that can compare to London's Roaring 1920's and New York's grooving 1980's. With the flamboyant, glamorous and often disaffected companionship of Bright Young People, the artists lose themselves. Portrayal Woman is for the poised and playfully refined woman who dares to defy. With a smoky yet sweet mÃ©lange created by the fusion of Craven A' Tobacco with a dusting of Vanilla, this scent is brought together with Jasmine at its top, Elemi at its base and heartened with Tuberose, recreating the 1920's liberation movement."," Jasmine, Vanilla, Tabacco, Tuberose",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/418096.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, jasmine
Brandied Pear Eau de Parfum,Panah London," Panah has quickly gained our attention for scents that effortlessly balance delectable gourmand elements with an everyday wearable lightness, and Brandied Pear may be the best of the bunch. Boasting a succulent, refreshing fruitiness to offset the dessert's decadent construction, this is less a gourmand, and more a fruit-forward delight with just enough vanillic sweetness to leave us swooning. The central player is, we're happy to confirm, the pear- mouthwatering, gently spiced, and sweetened not with syrupy sugar but rather just a touch of ripe banana. Only after we've had some time to exult in this perfect pear does it get the after-dinner treatment- a simmer in rich, warm, boozy brandy and a drizzle of indulgent vanilla cream. All the while, zesty lemon, verdant green leaves, and a wisp of soft musk keep things fresh and not too sweet, ensuring its unisex appeal. Pear lovers, this one's calling your name- don't miss out."," Lemon, banana, pear, green leaves, vanilla, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/828004.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, lemon
Mahabah Eau de Parfum,ANFAS," Mahaba, meaninglove but alsocharity in Arabic, is a unique floriental composition that conveys youthful innocence and lusty warmth in one breath. A bight candied lemon topnote yields to a startling ylang note that balances its usual impression of fruity, lush tropicalia with an undertone of leathery licorice or rubber. In the background, a sultry combination of vanilla and tonka bean creates a buff, creamy accent, like a bitter almond horchata dusted with candied aniseed sprinkles. Mahaba is gorgeously creamy but never too sweet, with something of the same licorice-and-coffee woodiness that lends Un Bois Vanille (Serge Lutens) its mysterious darkness. Later on, towards the final drydown, a striking note of salt or brine lurking in the wings pops out to create the curious effect of flowers mixed with a creamy, anisic milk and melon rind thickly encrusted with sea salt. Feminine, lovely, and unusual, Mahaba is a floral oriental tailor-made for those moments when you want your scent to convey a certain youthful sweetness but also a little twist that keeps people guessing."," petitgrain, rose, jasmine, ylang-ylang, tonka bean, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/825003.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, petitgrain
Shaghaf Eau de Parfum,ANFAS," Shaghaf, meaning passion or sensual desire in Arabic, is, for us, the jewel in the Anfas crown. The simplest way to describe it would be to say that it smells exactly like walking into a centuries-old majlis  a huge, carpeted room for receiving honored guests or conducting parliamentary business  in the heart of a Middle Eastern city. Shaghaf smells like old wood and textiles that have long absorbed the lusty aromas of burning oud wood, the preparation of tea and coffee boiled with cardamom and cloves, and the smoky sweetness of a million assorted grades of bakhoor seeping into hair, wool, and fur, and is now releasing them into the air, with a sigh.Shaghaf opens with a wave of thrillingly exotic notes, crested by a funky-smoky oud note that's been made even grimier with a lusty ginger and cardamom underlining. The spiced oud accord is like a beastly shadow that creeps along the walls along the Ka'aba, its presence dark and ever-present. But soon, all you notice is the heart of magnificently dry oud wood smoldering in the heat of the embers, peppered with chunks of amber resin and glittering with incense. Slowly, a worn leather note emerges  or maybe it is black tea  thick with a meaty stew of resin and spice. Shaghaf is a very dry but very rich perfume, a microcosm of everything we imagine the Middle East to smell like. But for all its husky desiccation, this is a wonderfully warm and inviting scent. With its toasty, sandy texture, Shaghaf occupies the same headspace as Fidelis (by Histoires de Parfum), Nanban (Arquiste), and Songe d'Un Bois en EtÃ© (Guerlain) but is much softer and smoother, with no harsh woody buzz around the edges. Silage and longevity are as monumental as the scent itself, but Shaghaf is the rare beastmode oriental that actually gets better and more interesting the longer it's on your skin. With the heat of your skin to get it going, the scent seems to expand and radiate off the skin in big, red-gold waves of aroma, undulating in richness and saturation. Color us impressed  this bad boy is a Muezzin's call to prayer in scent form, but there's nothing holy about it."," cardamom, ginger, citruses, leather, tobacco, cedar, cashmeran, patchouli, agarwood (oud), amber, vanilla, tolu balsam, opoponax",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/825005.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, cardamom
Red Ishq Eau de Parfum,ANFAS,"I cannot describe the moment your name is mentioned and I cannot express my love for you. You are me, I move with you. Red ISHQ is perfumer Asim Al Qassim's vision of the yin and yang of true love, the bittersweet sacrifice of submission balanced against the enveloping warmth of unconditional love. Accordingly, the initial burst of leathery saffron  dry, slightly bitter  is softened by a luscious raspberry and a cloud of rosy talc. Think Tuscan Leather's buttery suede jacket dusted with fuchsia-colored powder.Oakmoss takes the reins in the drydown, its distinctive aroma of dried sea lichen, marine ink, and sea grass giving the scent an interesting salty dryness that nevertheless stays firmly rooted in the leather genre rather than chypre. The drydown of Red ISHQ features a smoky ashy fir balsam note that paints a parallel between the balsamic freshness of Encens Flamboyant (Annick Goutal) and the abstract, crushed-ruby balminess of Baccarat Rouge (Maison Francis Kurkdijan). Despite the pert raspberry note up front, Red ISHQ is completely unisex  a uniquely fresh-but-rich saffron suede with a unami-ish bite that will make your mouth water."," jasmine, saffron, raspberry, amber, oakmoss, talc",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/825006.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, jasmine
Purple Sakan,ANFAS," Purple Sakan is a fragrance dedicated to nostalgia, and to the power that scent has to evoke not only a memory of an event, but of the distinctive emotional and sensory tableau of our most treasured moments. It is a wonder, an impressively spicy oriental that hides impressive complexity behind its subtle and agreeable facade of smooth amber. But as Purple Sakan develops and grows, the vibrance grows by leaps and bounds- earthy, green cardamom leaps from the skin, propelled by bright, dry citrus. Rich, savory coffee and cumin complement the creamy vanilla of the base, while other basenotes of sweet, earthy patchouli and clean musk let the spices continue to sing. Purple Sakan may be a specific reference to the nostalgia of Asim al Qassim's Emirati upbringing and the unique flavors and smells of an Arab kitchen, but the warmth and comfort infused in every drop of this magical elixir is universal."," Bergamot, cardamom, lemon, orange, amber, coffee, cumin, musk, patchouli, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/825008.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Rahaba Eau de Parfum,ANFAS," Rahaba is the Arabic word for openness, especially the openness required of a host. In Arab culture, the role of host is taken very seriously  and Rahaba is a scent that reflects the generosity of spirit required. It opens with a beguiling mixture of fresh and dried pineapple, mimicking the tray of sweetmeats typically offered to you upon arrival. A fizzy lemonade note injects the scent with ferocious sparkle and joie de vivre. There is a touch of gin, too  but it's more a fresh, outdoorsy juniper note than anything truly boozy. This barrage of vibrant, fruity, and fizzy notes are the interlude to a soft and restful bouquet of rose, which, lightly dusted with iris, lends a discreetly powdery texture to the scent. However, like a host who welcomes everyone with equal grace, both men and women alike will find Rahaba tremendously inviting. The bright candied pineapple and floral notes fade away slowly over a blond, freshly-cut woody accord that maintains the scent's sparkling feel. The drydown is curiously airy and salty, a nutty tonka bean holding it all together at the spine. Rahaba is, in its final hours, a mÃ©lange of tart fruity notes grafted onto a hugely spacious ambery musk  perhaps Ambrox  that expands the scent to room-filling proportions without losing any of its delicacy."," orange, gin, pineapple, Damask rose, Grasse rose, orris, tonka bean, sandalwood, vanilla, amber, almond, tolu balsam",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/825000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, orange
Sa'adah Eau de Parfum,ANFAS," Sa'adah is an Arabic name for girls that means happiness'. And indeed, this scent holds true to that inspiration. Opening with a bright, fresh candied orange note over a bed of violets and rose, the scent quickly establishes itself as a mood board of good vibes. Soft but vibrant pine and cedar notes lend the perky florals a touch of woody sourness, keeping the scent on an even keel. We see Sa'adah appealing to young women who like their flowers abstract rather than literal; the bouquet of flowers here is blurred, giving off only an impression of bright, candied freshness, and later on, when a voluptuous ylang enters the picture, a buttery richness. Crucially, though, Sa'adah smells clean and modern, with no aldehydes or powder to age' it. It is a happy, bright floral cut free of any association to floral perfumery of the past. A warm, resiny tonka and vanilla base wraps the florals up in a softly caramelized brown sugar haze that, while sweet, won't give anyone toothache. A happy floral for an upbeat sort of gal."," orange, rose, pine, neroli, violet, cedar, ylang-ylang, sandalwood, vanilla, tonka bean",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/825002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, orange
Velvet Splendour Perfume Concentrate,Goldfield & Banks," We absolutely adore mimosa-based scents, so when word arrived that the newest Goldfield & Banks would feature golden wattle, or Australian mimosa, we were delighted. But what we never could have anticipated is just how uniquely different from European mimosa golden wattle turns out to be- powdery and woodsy, with gentle tones of green fruit, this is a hearty and distinctive floral note all its own- one that truly captures the rugged beauty of the Flinders Ranges in Southern Australia where the wattle used in this fragrance is harvested. As Goldfield & Banks is so adept at accomplishing, every supplemental ingredient in this cheerfully complex floral brings out a new aspect of the golden wattle- bright, fresh mandarin, smooth orange blossom and jasmine, and soft, gently earthy woods produce a refined naturalism. If you're a mimosa lover looking for something you've never quite tried before, or if you're simply seeking a gorgeous and unique floral perfect for any occasion, Velvet Splendour is ray of warm sunshine."," Mandarin, hedione, mimosa absolute (South Australia), orange blossom, jasmin sambac, Australian sandalwood, patchouli, Haitian vetiver, leather, tonka, oppoponax, heliotropine",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/79507.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, mandarin
Gardens of India Eau de Parfum,Parle Moi de Parfum," Some fragrances achieve sophistication via complex arrangements of dozens or even hundreds of notes; others, however, know that a simply perfect ratio of a few simply perfect materials has the same capacity to astound. It's this latter philosophy that guides Gardens of India, a deeply romantic scent that deploys three wonderful ingredients- jasmine, tuberose, and sandalwood- to magnificent and unforgettable effect. As basic as the notes list may be, the astonishing balance of Gardens of India is a tribute to the over twenty years that master perfumer Michel Almairac spent refining the formula. It begins with jasmine buds, plucked in June and allowed to hatch before extracting their scent, in order to extract both lush white floral notes and a bright, dewey greenness. Tuberose is harvested in early autumn when the blooms are full, preserving the intense carnality and sweet richness of the majestic flower. Finally, the sandalwood, distilled to rich, woodsy, creamy perfection. The scent is romantic, full-bodied, and invigorating- everything a woodsy floral can and should be. Take a walk through the Gardens of India- we think you'll be surprised at how much you find waiting there."," Jasmine, tuberose, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76713.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, jasmine
Blackpepper Eau de Parfum,Comme des Garcons," Blackpepper is the pitch black of a starless sky rendered into perfume form. A perfect storm ofblack flavor molecules clash as if in a Super Collider  pungent black pepper, charred cedar, and smoky Akigala wood sparking off against each other and then pulling apart, over and over again. Wearing this scent is like slowly adjusting your eyes to pitch darkness; with time, an incredible wealth of detail is revealed. The fragrance is deep, hot, and oily, but at the same time, it's as dry as a bone. The burnt sugar of tonka bean softens the searing heat of the pepper, like the edge of a cedar log caramelizing on an open fire. A remarkably crisp, airy fragrance emerges phoenix-like from the hot ashes. Fierce enough to command attention, sophisticated enough to leave a lasting impression, Blackpepper is the kind of sexy, modern, avant-garde masterpiece that could only have come from Comme des GarÃ§ons."," Black pepper, cedar, patchouli, agarwood (oud), tonka bean, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/21646.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, black pepper
Odeur 71 Eau de Toilette,Comme des Garcons," The ultimate anti-perfume. The notes are inspired by dust on a hot lightbulb, bamboo, metal, electricity and lettuce juice...no lie! But what does it smell like? Surprisingly, it's a completely wearable scent; metal and electricity manifest as the invigorating smell of ozone just before a storm, and the combination of we-don't-know-what makes for a familiar soapy freshness. Hot laundry right out of the dryer served up on your clean, sexy Xerox machine. Released in 2000, Odeur 71 continues to make huge stir-not just for its revolutionary scent structure, but because it's a testament that a combination of the truly weird can make a truly fantastic fragrance."," incense, wood, moss, willow, elm, bay leaves, bamboo, hyacinth",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/21601.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, incense
2 MAN Eau de Toilette,Comme des Garcons," The fragrance that's causing crazed mobs to empty the shelves in Europe and Japan is here!  CdG 2 MAN is a revision of the original 2 (in the silver bottle), taking it in a more woody/incense direction and creating a whole new animal.  Smoldering at first, 2 MAN roars out of the gate, declaring its boldness and contempt for simpering little focus-group scents that are a mishmash of ""manly"" notes.  2 MAN's simmering and incensey opening unfolds into an unusual combination of nutmeg, vetiver and subtle saffron flowers, each one appearing like chapters in a book.  As the pages turn and it evolves on the skin, a subdued mahogany and leather bring up the rear. Daring but not brash or loud; complex yet never persnickety.  It's a sure-bet for a modern classic."," incense, white smoke, saffron flowers, nutmeg, vetiver roots, mahogany,  leather",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/21620.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, incense
Floriental Eau de Parfum,Comme des Garcons," Even if you were unfamiliar with the term, you'd know a 'floriental' when you smelled it- this fragrance family combining floral notes with the dark woods, spices and resins that distinguish orientals are so popular as to be nearly ubiquitous. But with Comme des GarÃ§ons, there's always a twist, and so Floriental, the newest fragrance from the avant garde Japanese/French fashion stalwart, has chosen as its floral of note the Cistus flower- a flower without a scent. And so, CDG's Floriental is a postmodern floral, one where the sweet, lush, peppery aspects of flowers are created from plum, pink pepper, and sandalwood, and where labdanum- the rich resin that's the true fragrant bounty of the cistus bush- forms the basis of the oriental notes for a floral oriental both innovative and yet true in spirit. And in the modern, mischievous style of Comme des GarÃ§ons, Floriental is even nontraditional in structure- without classically defined top, heart and base notes, the fragrance evolves in unpredictable waves, trading off between lush fruitiness, resinous woods and fiery spice with delightful frequency, resulting in a scent that wears differently each time. At once layered and unstructured, simple and modern, masculine and feminine, Floriental is a landscape of wonderful contradiction, with a single exception- it's 100% CDG."," Pink pepper, plum, incense, labdanum, sandalwood, vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/21643.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, pink pepper
Grace by Grace Coddington Eau de Toilette,Comme des Garcons,"I've always loved the smell of roses and the first fragrance I ever wore was rose water. Over time, I've experimented with everyone else's version of Rose, and even got sidetracked by some others along the way. Now I've arrived back at the point I first started, with Rose. Except this time, it's my Rose.  Grace CoddingtonAnd what a rose Grace has brought us. Fiesty and flirty, but with a dash of elegance, Grace by Grace Coddington opens with a wondrously fresh, delicately edgy opening of citrus and aromatics, all the while anchored by a youthful but deep rose supported with fruity depth. Vetiver and smooth, musky woods lend character and strength, but this is rose's party, and the lush, fresh, sexy florals are front-and-center to the very last compelling sniff. An icon like Grace deserves no less.Housed in a wonderfully feline-inspired bottle to celebrate Grace's lifelong love of cats."," Bergamot, mint, basil, cardamom, pink peppercorn, rose, freesia, peach blossom, vetiver, cashmere woods, white musk, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/21645.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Florane Demi Extrait,Nishane," Between light and dark, innocent and wicked, and EDP and extrait, lies Nishane's new Icons Collection- striking, seductive new scents presented in a ""demi extrait"" concentration and based around a central component. Florane is, you guessed it, a floral scent, with a powerful and complex heart of violet, muguet (lily of the valley), and jasmine, but if you're picturing a demure, powdered white floral, think again- kissed with bright, juicy fruit and sweetened with warm, ambered woods, Florane is a vivid, vibrant, unforgettably sexy floral rich with delightfully unexpected combinations. An opening of beautifully tart grapefruit and aromatic cassis set the stage for the aforementioned floral heart, which feels neither overly vintage nor simplistically youthful- rather, it's a sexy, modern, three-dimensional bouquet that grows more dynamic still with the warm, woodsy base of amber, hinoki, musk, and the perfect touch of sweet vanilla. The result is a striking, long-lasting, and complex floral that can transition from sweatpants to soirees and back again without breaking stride. In other words, just the kind of versatile, creative, and compelling stunner we've come to expect from every new Nishane release."," Grapefruit, cassis, violet, muguet, jasmine, amber, hinoki, musk, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/774055.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, grapefruit
L'Eau de Reims,Reims Parfums," L'Eau de Reims smells very French. Primarily an essay on the fresh, celery-like greenness of petitgrain and neroli, Duchaufour twists things in a slightly chyprÃ© direction with a generous lick of salty, dark green oakmoss. Even more delightfully, proceedings open here with a volley of bitter, lemony eau de cologne-style notes that last just long enough to jolt its wearer awake. The real star of L'Eau de Reims, however, is that remarkable petitgrain-neroli accord. Although neroli is not listed, we're sure we smell its modulating influence here, softening the lemony sharpness of the petitgrain with its characteristic soapy freshness and its lingering vegetal notes. A hint of geranium emphasizes the spicy, leafy greenness of the neroli. Oakmoss provides structure to the drydown, supporting the freshness of the petitgrain-neroli heart with a robust, salty minerality that never strays into dankness. We think L'Eau de Reims is a real tour de force for summer wear  as fresh and clean as a traditional eau de cologne, yet with the salty heft of a properly French chypre base. A new classic in the making? We think so."," Petitgrain, neroli, incense, geranium, oakmoss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/82402.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, petitgrain
Haute Provence Eau de Cologne,PARFUMS DE NICOLAI," While wild lavender abounds throughout the countryside of Provence,  master perfumers know that ""true lavender, "" that which only grows at an altitude above 1200 meters,  has no substitute- boasting both fresher,  more camphorous tones and a sweeter,  richer,  warmer tone as it dries,  it's a superior material in every way to its common counterpart. So it's no surprise that Mme. Patricia de Nicolai,  perhaps the greatest living inheritor of the grand legacy of vintage French perfumery,  accepts nothing less than Haute Provence lavender in her fragrances,  and believes in its value as an ingredient so much that she presents it here,  with minimal embellishment,  as an eau de cologne- and the results are impressive. If anything,  the openness of an EDC lets the star ingredient shine,  delivering intensely sharp,  bright freshness up top,  complemented with spicy,  citric petitgrain,  and then drying to a smooth,  creamy iris-paired musky woodsiness that lingers with just the right amount of unassuming confidence on the skin. A classic eau de cologne is a vivid,  fresh sensory experience meant to strip away the levels of artifice between fragrance and nature. By those standards,  Haute Provence is an unmistakable gem."," Petitgrain, bergamot, lavender, iris, musk, cedar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/31359.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, petitgrain
Ani Extrait de Parfum,Nishane," An ancient metropolis now abandoned to the ages, Ani and its many ruined churches now stand as a monument to the both the majesty of empire and the inevitability of time. To honor this mystical place and capture its unique evolution, Nishane has created a fragrance that juxtaposes bright freshness, fiery spice, rugged woods, and rich warmth- a true voyage through the ages. Ani opens with a bright, bracingly fresh and green bergamot- overflowing with juicy citrus and the snap of fresh vegetation, evoking the overgrowth that has retaken the crumbled walls. A blazing wash of gingery spice suggests the life that still remains, while a gorgeous, fruity rose peeks from between ancient stone. We feel the power of history, now, as rich, creamy, resinous vanilla and rich, earthy wood echo with multitude of voices now left to history. Complex, robust, and vibrant, Ani is a fragrance with true heritage to its name."," Bergamot, green notes, blue ginger, pink pepper, blackcurrant, Turkish rose, cardamom, patchouli, cedarwood, vanilla, benzoin, ambergris, musk, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/774052.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Unutamam Extrait de Parfum,Nishane," As the first entry in Nishane's bold new ""Experimental Collection, "" Unutamam was bound to defy easy categorization. But that turns out to be the point: as conceived by Nishane and star fragrance blogger and creator Miguel Matos,  Unutamam (the name of a famous Turkish song) intentionally straddles the line between lush seduction and animalic ferocity,  leaving it to the wearer to decide which mood to allow the scent to embody. Unutamam,  from first spray,  is an intense experience: a whip's lash of lacerating aromatics and florals,  defying any attempt at a complacent reaction. Even as the florals grow smoother and lusher,  a smoky,  industrial undertone grows,  with patchouli,  labdanum,  and castoreum approximating the animalic thrum of petroleum,  the rough protection of military-grade leather. Or perhaps your journey into this intriguing and dynamic fragrance takes you in the other direction,  to a garden of herbaceous delight and sweet,  smooth caramelized amber. After all,  the choice is entirely yours- and what an accomplishment that is."," lavender, rosemary, mint, juniper, jasmine, carnation, patchouli, amber, oregano, castoreum, cistus, oakmoss, caramel",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/774053.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, lavender
Milano Cento For Him Eau de Toilette,Milano Cento," A bona fide 1980's cult classic, Milano Cento was born in an era of cultural futurism and modernist design, but with an eye towards the classics. Now, nearly 40 years later, it's never been more compelling. Inspired by the wonderfully diverse, aromatic plants of Italy, Milano Cento Him opens with zesty, sparkling notes of lemon, bergamot and green petitgrain. Herbaceous notes of lavender and rosemary combine with the intensity of basil and clary sage, followed by rich, sensual sandalwood and patchouli. Spicy clove, cinnamon, amber and warm musks live in the memory and in the heart. Sophisticated and stylish, this blend of vintage flair and modern energy is designed to keep the past alive while stepping boldly into the future."," Lemon, bergamot, petitgrain, lavender, rosemary, basil, clary sage, sandalwood, patchouli, clove, cinnamon, amber, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/823000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, lemon
Rahat Loukhoum Eau de Parfum,Serge Lutens," Not truly loukhoum, with its rosy gelatin texture, but rather freshly baked pasticche di mandrel, those bone-white, chewy little almond cookies sold everywhere in Rome. If you've ever tried them, then you'll know that they are not as tooth-achingly sweet as they appear, the bitterness of cherry pit cutting through the thick dusting of confectioner's sugar. It's that balance of bitter and sweet that makes you dip greedily into the bag again and again.And so it is with Rahat Loukoum. The sweet honey, almonds, and creamy vanilla are glossed with just enough bitter cherries, hawthorn, and balsams to stop you from putting your wrist in your mouth. The base, surprisingly resinous, exerts firm control over the sweet, fluffy heliotrope, and walks the fragrance straight down the line of edible-inedible. Rahat Loukoum is that rare scent is that is far from your average gourmand-- though with Serge Lutens' pedigree, we're guessing you already knew that. Please note that Palais Royal Collection bell jars are splash bottles"," Aldehydes, almond, cherry, hawthorn, rose, heliotrope, white honey, vanilla, tonka bean, balsam, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36157.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, aldehydes
Sarrasins Eau de Parfum,Serge Lutens," Rich yet airy and clear', Sarrasins is the sheer silk shawl to La Nuit's dense buttercream satin. Famously alluring, this scent derives its charm from the juxtaposition of innocence and sensuality. Though the opening is a burst of crystalline jasmine sharpened with a needlepoint of camphor and other mysterious greenery (privet hedge? mint?), its freshness is immediately counterpoised by a smudge of inky indole. Sarrasins is very elegant and very French - a rudely botanical hothouse flower styled and teased up into a chignon. In the heart, hints of hay and tea give the jasmine a transparency it does not possess in real life. The dry clove-like spiciness of carnation is framed against the crispness of green apples and grapes taken straight from the chiller. Beneath this impression of freshness, however, a sultry osmanthus and castoreum slyly join forces to create a dark, dry apricot leather that smells like skin at the nape of the neck. Sarrasins' je ne sais quoi emanates from this contrast between a living flower tumbling off a vine and the soft, skin-like suede notes that give it an abstract sophistication.

Winter Palace Eau de Parfum,MEMO," A stunning fantasia of fiery resins and smooth tea, Winter Palace is a mythological vision of China where dragons soar and intrigue lurks behind every gate. We're swept away from the opening burst of rich, oily, tea-infused citrus- miles from both the salty freshness of a Mediterranean citrus scent or the sunny sweetness of a California one- balanced against robust, gently toasty matÃ©. The exotic richness only deepens from here, as the distinctive red tea heart, earthy and subtly tart, takes on richer, more resinous character with a cascade of balsamic woods, as awe-inspiring and powerful as the serpentine form of a Chinese dragon undulating along the hill-studded landscape like a Great Wall in motion. As a deep, warm, vanilla-rich amber emerges in the base, we feel the true power of the scent, compelling and unique, imbued with ancient sophistication but glowing with vibrant potency. If you yearn for the ultimate combination of bright and rich, power and refinement- discover Winter Palace today."," Grapefruit, bergamot, lemon, mate, gurjum balsam, amber wood, tolu, benzoin, labdanum, red tea, tonka, styrax, vanilla, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/69125.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, grapefruit
Sundazed Eau de Parfum,BYREDO," Say hello to endless summer. Sundazed,  the newest scent from Byredo,  is an infectiously joyful blend of bright citrus,  sugared florals,  and a sparkling skin musk that fans of Blanche already know and love. It's a love letter to spontaneous daytrips and wholesome indulgences- the citrus is zesty,  mouthwatering,  and energetic,  the neroli heart rich,  romantic,  and made deliciously sweet with a sugared note of fresh-spun cotton candy. And it all dries down to a clean,  soft musk that glows for hours with the gentle warmth of sun-kissed skin after a long day of outdoor adventures. And when we say ""endless summer, "" that's exactly what we mean- since Sundazed is now part of Byredo's permanent collection,  you can experience this little slice of beachside bliss whenever you want. So whenever you need to change your mood- or keep the good times rolling- this is the one to reach for."," Mandarin, lemon, neroli, jasmine sambac, cotton candy, skin musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/641203.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, mandarin
Eau de Minthe Eau de Parfum,Diptyque," Invented in 1882 with the release of Houbigant's Fougere Royale, the distinctively fresh, classically masculine fougere is a stalwart of fine European fragrance- and until now, there's never been an entry from the equally iconic house of Diptyque. But in case you haven't figured it out from the name, Eau de Minthe is not your (great-great-?) grandfather's fougere; rather, it's an impressively clever twist on a classic that replaces the standard lavender-geranium-oakmoss DNA of a fougere with an electric jolt of mouthwatering mint in place of the lavender. Not only does this provide a striking unisex balance to a typically masculine genre, but it builds on a molecular connection between mint and geranium that lends the floral heart of the scent a dynamic aromatic resonance. As a soft patchouli base with a touch of mossy rose lends gentle strength, Eau de Minthe takes the form of a recognizable fougere- but never so much that its delightful individuality is lost. Vibrant, fresh, and utterly unique, Eau de Minthe is a new classic fougere to stand alongside the greats."," Mint, geranium, patchouli, rose oxide",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/483300.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, mint
Splendiris Eau de Parfum,Dusita," With the tremendous visual and olfactory beauty of the iris comes a unique challenge- how does one create an iris scent that improves upon what nature has already perfected? In the case of the truly magical newest release from Dusita, the answer lies in the subtleties- Splendiris showcases an utterly breathtaking orris absolute in all of its cool, purple, rich, and powdered glory, with just the right amount of fresh, dark, and gourmand supplemental notes to modernize, brighten, and smooth the whole experience into the realm of the sublime.Splendiris opens with a burst of juicy citrus and lively, gently aromatic green notes that feel fresh and contemporary, wiping clean your preconceptions about what an iris scent can be. As the richly floral heart emerges, we swoon over the elegance and richness of the orris butter, but further exploration reveals Splendiris to be much more than a single expensive ingredient- here, the natural rooty, powdery sophistication of iris is sweetened with violet and fig and given luscious texture with rose and jasmine to create a true bouquet. A perfect dollop of luxuriously creamy vanilla alongside woodsy vetiver and cedar enriches further, creating a rare fragrant plateau where sensuality, style, and naturalism share top billing. In other words, Splendiris is objectively an iris soliflore- but if all you smell is the iris, you're not paying attention to the dozens of brilliant combinations that make for the most gorgeously idealized iris you've ever experienced. While we've grown to expect world-class scents with each new Dusita release, Splendiris is, even by those standards, in a class of its own."," Bergamot, mandarin, orange, violet leaf, fig leaf, carrot seed, sweet orris butter, iris, violet, rose de mai, jasmine sambac, vanilla, vetiver, cedar, ambergris",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/74607.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot

Each hair perfume combines one of BYREDO's signature scents with a unique silicone and polymer formula to create a light, invisible veil designed to leave the hair nourished and luminous whilst divinely scented. Rose of No Man's Land is centered around the delicate petals of a Turkish rose, both strikingly lush and softly sweet. A radiant chord of raspberry gives the heart notes fruit-laden depth, while a papyrus wood base and white amber chord add an eternal and sophisticated aura, delivering, in total, a rosebud of immense purity."," Pink pepper, Turkish rose petals, raspberry blossom, Turkish rose absolute, papyrus, white amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/641202.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, pink pepper
Lavender Extreme Eau de Parfum,TOM FORD Private Blend," Fresh. Divergent. Stimulating.Tom Ford transcends the traditional limits of scent with Lavender Extreme. Lavender is reworked and refracted like is never has been before to become something irreverently new a stunning, electric creation to be worn at maximum volume. Lavender is upended, translated from its storied origin in Provence and into a fresh subversion of itself. What We Think The normally relaxing scent of lavender gets a jolt of electricity in this intensely bright, invigoratingly modern fragrance with a sexy, spicy-warm tonka drydown."," Lemon, violet, lavender, geranium, rose, cinnamon, tonka Click Here For Ingredients ÃClose Lavender Extreme by TOM FORD Private Blend Ingredients Please be aware that ingredient lists may change or vary from time to time.

Ganymede Eau de Parfum,Marc-Antoine Barrois," Ganymede, the rocky satellite of Jupiter discovered in 1610 by Galileo, both luminous and covered with salt-water oceans. In collaboration with Quentin Bisch, Marc-Antoine Barrois has dreamt of the essence of this new planet: an elegant and unexpected harmony around a quartet of mandarin, violet, immortelle and suede.Ganymede once again makes use of the suede-leathery notes that made their first collaboration, B683, an instant classic. This time though, the leather notes become softer, gaining lightness and gentleness in contact with the fragrance of violet. Mandarin still brings intense brightness and vivacity, yet immortelle adds sublime balance, using salty and mineralic tones to act as a striking counterpoint. A galactic olfactory harmony both delicate and balanced, full of energy, sensuality, and contrast, Ganymede is quite unlike any fragrance on the planet- or elsewhere. What We Think A saltier, more floral interpretation of the ultra-smooth top grain leather also featured in B683- airy but still substantial."," Mandarin, saffron, violet, osmanthus absolute, akigalawood, Immortelle absolute",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/822001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, mandarin
No. 1 Tonic Blanc Eau de Parfum,Thomas Kosmala," As fresh and as effortlessly elegant as a clean white shirt on a hot Sunday morning. No. 1 Tonic Blanc brilliantly captures neroli's quirk of being both juicy and bone-dry at the same time, like an orange squeezed into a glass of ice-cold vermouth. The neroli note is astonishingly pithy at first, its tartness boldly underlined by bergamot, mandarin, and the waxy green leafiness of the neroli itself. It's a slap in the face of heat.As the heart develops, the bitterness of the citrus notes is mellowed out with a softly honeyed orange blossom note and the cheerful brightness of mock orange. Yet, the scent never entirely devolves into the lush sweetness of white flowers. The sparkling, vermouth-like dryness that forms the core of the scent is shored up by a stirringly mossy, woodsy basenote and a musk that extends the just-washed linen muskiness of the neroli. This one's easy  a crisp, no-brainer neroli stunner for fighting your corner in the heat. Fantastic on both women and men."," bergamot, mandarin, orange, neroli, orange flower blossom, bergamot flower blossom, mock orange flower, oakmoss, sandalwood, cedarwood, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/82000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
No. 2 Seve Nouvelle Eau de Parfum,Thomas Kosmala," SÃ¨ve Nouvelle is the scent of new sap rising, of boundless energy roiling up and out - a sense of excitement that can no longer be contained. With its opening salvo of pink grapefruit effervescing upwards in a surge of creamy white soap bubbles, this cannot fail to make you smile. A playful raspberry brings a blush to the buttery saffron suede lying just beneath, while the joyous pop of champaca flower makes you think of those clear green shampoos that Wella Balsam made in the 1970's that were half-woods, half-Granny Smith apple. This peppery explosion of citrus and flowers fizzes brightly for a while before folding itself into a soft, incensey drydown that's almost creamy with amber and cashmeran. SÃ¨ve Nouvelle goes from spiky to fuzzy in one seamless swoop, a soft, raspberry-tinted putty note remaining in place all the way through. While this is a very modern take on fruit, flowers, and suede, a stirring wisp of temple incense in the base gives SÃ¨ve Nouvelle a stirring sense of the exotic and the familiar all at once."," grapefruit, pink pepper, saffron, champaca, tonka bean, water pepper, patchouli, raspberry, cashmeran, amberwood, labdanum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/82001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, grapefruit
No. 3 Crepuscule Ardent Eau de Parfum,Thomas Kosmala," CrÃ©puscule Ardent sets a smoky strand of red-gold saffron to smolder in an incense burner, while a temple attendant weaves jasmine blossoms through our hair. Echoes of a sweet Tuscan Leather-like aroma tease us, the heat magnifying the fug of soft leather, spice, and flowers until its fills the room. The intense aroma of saffron and jasmine is both pungent and creamy, like a lover's breath on the nape of the neck. CrÃ©puscule Ardent's sexy leather is bold, then increasingly soft and milky as an Arabian style amber settles in towards the base. Nothing sweet or syrupy, however  here, a, monumental frankincense note lends the scent a charcoal dust purity that cleanses the air and cuts through the fat. This is the scent that a Valkyrie wears as they stride towards the pyre, a glorious vision of black and gold light."," saffron, olibanum, jasmine, leather, suede, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/82002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, saffron
No. 5 Frenesie Eau de Parfum,Thomas Kosmala," While most oud fragrances are proud and severe, their throaty, animalic rasp giving pause for thought, FrÃ©nÃ©sie is as soft and inviting as a freshly powdered bosom. Cowed into submission by an expansive floral bouquet dominated by an apricotty osmanthus, the oud is pushed to the edges of the scent, where it hums away sottovoce. Dressed up in this cloak of jammy florals, the oud is transformed into a glazed lychee tart that teeters on that quirky, Japanese-esque line between floral and fruity. The soft, gummy suede lurking beneath is the perfect counterpart to the syrupy osmanthus and roses, streaked here and there with a peppery peony bite. If we didn't know better, we'd swear there's violet in here too, casting an ethereal purple glow over the bouquet that holds it all together. Either way, the oud just a whisper, a faint trace of something woody in the lower register. A fuzzy haze of musk brings up the rear, diffusing the fudgy floral center into a spacey lightness. Lovely, and quite innocent-smelling."," saffron, bergamot, magnolia, rose, peony, osmanthus, gardenia, oud, amber, incense, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/82004.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, saffron
No. 7 Le Sel de la Terre Eau de Parfum,Thomas Kosmala," Le Sel de la Terre is proof that Leonardo da Vinci's assertion thatsimplicity is the ultimate sophistication is correct. Infuse a cloudy white musk with fresh lemon and crusty sea salt notes, and what you have is utter perfection. If it sounds trite or you think it's been done to death, then know that Kosmala's take distinguishes itself from the pack simply by virtue of smelling entirely natural, even when it is (clearly) not. The musk here is clean and sweet, a puff of laundry-hot air strangely unblemished by the chemical twang of cleaning solvents and enlivened with an expensive-smelling medley of lemon and bergamot. Le Sel de la Terre is a white shirt freshly pulled from the dryer, draped on a clean body, and generously doused in Monsieur Balmain, a paragon of elegance in its pairing of blond wood and citrus. A salty undertone is just enough to suggest the mineral tang of the beach without making you think of Calone or Ambroxan. Fantastic. We know what we're drenching ourselves this summer."," bergamot, Italian lemon, fresh marine notes, aqua, fresh floral, fresh wood, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/82006.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
No. 8 Tonic Vert Eau de Parfum,Thomas Kosmala," Tonic Vert is a true tonic for the winter blues. With its crushed mint and sour citrus topnotes, the scent starts out with the stinging clarity of early morning sunshine cutting across a dark room. Unlike other green fragrances, it is neither soapy-soft or sappy-juicy. Rather, it is dry, dry, dry throughout, an essential bitterness focusing the mind and straightening the spine. Yet this is not a classic green scent like No. 19 or even Green Irish Tweed  Tonic Vert makes a feature of its modern single-mindedness. Though more naturalistic than abstract or synthetic, it nonetheless manages to convey an impression of crisp angularity that feels more at home in a boardroom than on a ramble through the fields. The combination of that earthy, bitter vetiver with the strange pink fruitiness of pomelo and the minty rosiness of geranium is arresting to the nth degree: in the murky darkness of deep winter, you'll want to spray this over and over just to let the light in again."," bergamot, lemon, mandarin, lime, mint, geranium, pomelo, vetiver, musk, oakmoss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/82007.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Beaute du Diable Eau de Parfum,Liquides Imaginaires," ""Would you be willing to sell your soul to the Devil to possess his perfume? This essence is part of his powers, of his eternal seduction."" So reads Liquides Imaginaires' tagline for Beaute du Diable, a spicy, sweet, richly aromatic concoction that opens like a perfect gin on the rocks before taking a turn into richly spicy florals and aromatic cypress before settling into a dusty, smoky, smolderingly sexy fragrance that's as irresistible as it is hard to define. Picture the devil as a gorgeously androgynous figure in an immaculately tailored suit strolling towards you down a gaslamp-lit cobblestone alley, a puff of smoke rising from the street with each footstep. You're nervous, but intrigued, and as soon as their scent hits your nose, you know that for tonight, at least, you're going to go wherever they want you to go. That's the seductive, mysterious power of Beaute du Diable."," Lemon, coriander, bitter orange, gin accord, absinthe, clove, cypress, geranium, ylang ylang, carnation, vetiver, gaiac, cistus, cobblestone accord",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/73218.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, lemon
Amber Cologne Eau de Parfum,Bortnikoff," What makes Bortnikoff scents so special is not merely the inclusion of exceptional materials, but the vision required to do something novel and amazing with them. Take Amber Cologne, which features an impressive amount of real grey and brown ambergris, in all of its richly mineralic salty-sweet glory. It's an increasingly rare star player in perfume, so who in their right mind would put it into an ordinary citrus-and-woods cologne? It seems Bortnikoff would, and the results turn out to be far from ordinary. It doesn't hurt that the citrus in question is eye-poppingly fresh, an arresting blend of juicy bergamot, zesty lemon, sweet orange, and deliciously tart grapefruit, making the mouth water and the senses ignite. And once ignited, we find ourselves primed for the most gorgeously comfortable blend of ambergris and woods we could ever hope for- salty and gently animalic, to be sure, but moreover simply aglow with a luminous warmth that drills through every level of artifice in your memory to connect with the perfect ideal of sun-kissed skin at the beach- soft, smooth, and unbelievably sexy. Flourishes of florals and real oud provide support and structure, coaxing every last aspect from the ambergris, which glows for untold hours of sheer bliss. Perhaps the easiest-to-wear Bortnikoff yet, Amber Cologne is a simple, wonderful idea executed with flawless mastery and unparalleled quality."," Bergamot, Lemon, White and Pink Grapefruit, Sweet Orange, Cardamom, Frangipani, Jasmine Sambac, Virginia Cedarwood, Sandalwood, Grey and Brown Ambergris, Oud from Sri Lanka, Bouya Oud, Vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/804007.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Musk Khabib Extrait de Parfum,Bortnikoff," Musk Khabib isn't so much a fragrance as an experience. Sure, it's a wonderfully opulent chypre built on bright bergamot, spicy florals, and a rich yet fresh base of moss and musk the likes of which are rarely seen in modern perfumery. But we can't shake the feeling that it wasn't even meant to wear in public, but rather for the true perfume lover to lock themselves away from the world and apply heavily, shaking with giddy delight as each sniff brings a wholly novel combination of its featured notes: one moment intensely bright and spicy, the next warm and animalic, then perhaps creamy and sweet, and back again- an overflowing and ever-replenishing treasure chest of olfactory riches. It's a collector's scent, the kind you'll vacillate between wanting to use up in a single day and save forever. Lovers of Areej Le Dore's Russian Musk, and those who never got a chance to try it, your opportunity to exult in a truly vintage-style musk scent has come around again. Don't miss it."," Bergamot, Cardamom, Nutmeg, Ylang-Ylang, Cedarwood, Tolu Balsam, Ambergris, Deer Musk, Oakmoss, Vetiver, Tonka Bean, Vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/804008.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Sensual Instinct Eau de Parfum,Montale," Lush, sweet, and deeply intoxicating, Sensual Instinct is a journey through a kaleidoscopic fantasyland where mouthwatering fruit, romantic florals, and rich gourmand notes intertwine with uncontrollable abandon. A must-have for lovers of truly full-bodied fragrance, it's an explosion of deeply resonant, highly colorful scents certain to get your pulse racing. Every moment is full of contrast and serendipitous pairings, as an opening of ultra-bright bergamot and mandarin is matched with sweet, smooth cardamom and boozy whiskey. As the ambered, lushly drawn florals of the heart notes swell, so too does a delectable tiramisu accord, all set against a rich, gently earthy patchouli. And as the gourmand base of coffee, cacao, and vanilla intensifies, so too does the seductive power of this unforgettable scent. Lose yourself in the delicious haze of Sensual Instinct- your body knows what to do."," Bergamot, mandarin, cardamom, saffron, whisky, amberwood, jasmine, rose, tiramisu, patchouli leaves, cacao, coffee, vanilla, oakmoss, cedarwood, white musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/354009.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Vetiver Patchouli Eau de Parfum,Montale," With so much attention paid to Montale's rich, complex florientals and gourmands, it's easy to forget how well they do fresh and spicy (hello Red Vetiver!). And so it is with great pleasure that we introduce Vetiver Patchouli, a fiercely bright and fiery spicy-fresh fragrance that ignites the senses and invigorates the spirit. From the eye-popping burst of citrus and pink pepper in the opening to the surprising combination of gently sweet carrot, rich jasmin grandiflorum, and woodsy patchouli of the heart, and finally, the complexity of the spicy, woodsy, delicately earthy vetiver base, which lingers for hours with a sheer masculine sensuality that, truth be told, is every bit as captivating on a woman who prefers action to talk. While we're never upset with any new release from this venerable house, let us be the first to say: welcome back, Fresh Montale. We've missed you."," Bergamot, mandarin, pink pepper, carrot, jasmine, patchouli, vetiver, white musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/354010.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Oud Dream Eau de Parfum,Montale," When one thinks of a Montale oud, lavishly exotic and over-the-top cocktails of fruit and musk come to mind. And while those are wonderful, Oud Dream is a different sort of oud scent, a delicately sweet and spicy musky oud better suited for a romantic night under the desert stars instead of a disco ball, no matter what it might look like on the bottle. The key difference is a lovely touch of restraint- notes like ""sweet honey"" and black pepper are, in fact, handled deftly, never sticky-sweet or nose-crunchingly spicy. Even the rose-oud of the heart is toned down from the opulence of Roses Musk, feeling smooth and romantic and keeping you leaning in for more. Don't get us wrong- there's still a place for the opulence of Montale's other oud scents. But once the sun sets, the situation calls for a touch of elegance- and that's when Oud Dream has its chance to shine."," Bergamot, cardamom, coriander, black pepper, sweet honey, rose, oud, patchouli, cedar, leather, amber, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/354011.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Aenotus Parfum Extrait,Puredistance," On a rocky bluff at the edge of the mythical isle of Aeolia, a mythic God tends to the divine winds. At a moment's notice, he is ready to release them in all their elemental force, to sweep across the lands of ancient Europe, carrying in their embrace the contrasting powers of creation and destruction. This is the power of Aenotus, itself a fragrance of contrast: freshness and warmth, comfort and primal power. While Puredistance founder Jan Ewoud Vos has a personal connection to every scent, Aenotus was conceived to be his signature- a scent that had to be instantly refreshing, while also presenting a rich, long-lasting second phase more sophisticated than your average ""fresh"" scent. And with the help of master perfumer Antoine Lie, Aenotus delivers, wowing us with an eye-popping, euphoric burst of complex citrus and mint notes that smoothly flows into a warm, deeply sensual base of mossy skin musk that lingers on skin for hours and clothes for days. This rare achievement is possible via Puredistance's no-matter-the-cost philosophy, as Aenotus boasts an astounding, unprecedented 48% perfume oil concentration developed over three painstaking years. Was it worth it? Close your eyes, spray it on, and when your feet finally touch the ground again, decide for yourself."," Orange, mandarin, lemon, yuzu, mint, blackcurrant bud, petitgrain, oakmoss, patchouli, musks",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/53022.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, orange
Tabac Eau de Parfum,La Via Del Profumo," Tobacco fragrances often get the weight' thing wrong. Too much amber or vanilla, and it sinks under the heft of its own richness, but too light and it feels like a sheer wash of ash on the skin. Tabac by Abdes Salaam Attar gets it right by pairing a bold tobacco leaf with a sheer dried-fruit amber and a bitter, earthy vanilla - elements that serve to modulate each other's behavior and sidestep any excessive sweetness. The tobacco leaf in Tabac is raw and uncured, even a bit rough around the edges. Its honest-to-goodness rustic charm is complemented by the quasi-animalic woodiness of sticky black vanilla pod and the buttery, cherry-almond bitterness of tonka bean. As you might imagine, the result is incredibly rich. But fear not! The resinous amber underpinning the tobacco, vanilla, and tonka bean crown is so dry that there's no danger of this tipping over into syrup. Tabac is simply vigorous, handsome, and very well-built. It's the perfect mid-weight tobacco perfume: substantial enough to be satisfying and spacious enough to wear without feeling crushed under the weight of super-rich materials. In a word  suave."," tobacco, vanilla, tonka bean, labdanum, spicy notes, resins",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/81607.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, tobacco
Isle of Man Eau de Parfum,Frapin," You are invited to experience the exhilaration of life lived at 100mph, whipping down the wind-swept coastlines and tight mountain curves of the Isle of Man in all its famed race-week splendor. Born of a collaboration between Frapin founder (and motorsports enthusiast) David Frossard and perfumer Alienor Massenet, Isle of Man is a testament to adventure, a crisp, fierce adrenaline rush of citrus, florals and oceanic zest that stirs the soul. In each breath, we feel the sparkle of sunlight in notes of grapefruit and bitter orange, while herbaceous, floral and salt notes brings the uniquely British beauty of the island into vivid contrast- fresh, wild basil, fields of wildflowers, and the bracing freshness of ocean air. It's the kind of wonderful, fully realized men's scent that's every bit as sexy on her- the only prerequisite is an untamed soul."," Grapefruit, bitter orange, basil, salt accord, freesia, violet, ironwood, vetiver, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/22619.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, grapefruit
Desert Suave Eau de Parfum,Liquides Imaginaires," Imagine opening your eyes in the throes of a dream amidst the shifting sands of a vast and unknowable golden desert. The light floods your perception, and at first, all you see is brightness- a blinding, arresting burst of pure citrus that energizes your senses. As you adjust to the heat and light, a vision emerges, a caravan in the center of the golden sea, resplendent with untold riches of silk and spice. You smell sweet cardamom, sticky honeyed dates, and the nutty, savory smoothness of sesame, all carried on a breeze of aromatic cedar logs piled high atop the wagon. This may be but a dream, you tell yourself, but it's all the more enchanting for it, the aromas diffused with a floral airiness that elevates the romantically exotic atmosphere, without even a hint of animalics or roughness. This is the dreamworld of Desert Suave. We think you'll like it here."," Cardamom, mandarin, orange blossom, rose, date, sesame, cedar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/73217.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, cardamom
Lust In Paradise Eau de Parfum,Ex Nihilo," A voyage to the French Riveria, by way of a blissful dream. That's the enchanting promise of Lust In Paradise, the newest entry in Ex Nihilo's exquisite Les Interdites collection- an undeniably dreamlike floral that weds lush white peony to a vibrant blend of spice, fruit and musk to create a hypnotically romantic journey to a fairytale destination.Our vacation begins with a zesty sparkle of pink pepper, setting the stage for the brightness of white peonies, awash in a mouthwatering waterfall of fresh, gently tart lychee, creating a swoon-worthy rush of smooth sensuality. As it dries, an addictive signature of cedarwood and musk furthers our Riveria dreams with the unmistakable feeling of skin warmed by the Mediterranean sun.

Yuzu Eau de Parfum,J-Scent," A refreshing scent of the Japanese citrus fruit Yuzu and thyme. A fine citrus accord of bergamot and orange with the distinguishing presence of yuzu and thyme. Yuzu adds to the perfume a bittersweet accent. The lustrous aroma of Japanese citrus yuzu is sensuously fresh and elegantly sweet.

Sumo Wrestler Eau de Parfum,J-Scent," The scent of bintsuke (hair oil) subtly floating from dignified sumo wrestlers. Eucalyptus and anise give this perfume an aromatic scent, and the notes of violet and heliotrope flowers creates a powdery scent, which is the characteristic of bintsuke. Last notes, musk and the combination of patchouli and sandalwood arrive. This scent represents the power and grace of a sumo wrestler, combined with a gentle, incense-like warmth. What We Think A warm-but-fresh combination of aromatic, sweet floral, and lightly powdery wood notes gives this dynamic scent the feel of a barbershop masculine through an eastern lens."," Orange, Eucalyptus, Anise, Cinnamon, Heliotrope, Violet, Orange Flower, Labdanum, Sandalwood, Patchouli, Jasmine",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/814008.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, orange

The nostalgic and bittersweet fragrance brings a heartwarming purity wrapped in a gently sweet base of honey. What We Think An everyday combination presented with distinction- the lemon is bright, clear, and fresh, and the honey is sweet, soft, and balsamic. If you love citrus but are looking for something more relaxing than energizing, Honey & Lemon is a perfect choice."," Lemon, Orange, Peach, Rose, Jasmine, Musk, Sandalwood, Honey Note",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/814010.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, lemon
Elixir Pour Femme Extrait de Parfum,Roja Parfums," While Roja Dove's reputation as the king of fine fragrance comes from his ability to create scents that conjure the bygone glory of pre-regulation grandeur, he's no less adept at delivering sleeker scents that still hum with high-end luxury. Elixir Pour Femme, a smoothly soft, sweet, fruit-infused stunner that exudes Roja's signature richness with a decidedly fresher, more modern profile. Elixir's signature interplay between fresh and lush is evident from the very beginning, as a bergamot brightness merely sets the tone for a dynamic bouquet featuring lily of the valley, rose, ylang, and heliotrope, sweetened with mouthwatering notes of raspberry and peach. Gently spiced woods add warmth and depth alongside vanilla and an exquisite, buttery orris, while a smooth blend of premium musks and ambrette radiate sensuality. Taken as a whole, the impressive array of notes feels agile, sexy, and fashion-forward. Elixir isn't your grandmother's Roja Dove scent- but we think even she'd agree you smell fabulous."," Bergamot, lily of the valley, geranium, rose de mai, jasmine, ylang ylang, heliotrope, violet, raspberry, peach, violet leaf, cinnamon, cedar, cashmere wood, sandalwood, vanilla, orris, cedar, ambrette, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/74852.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Cuir Mauresque Eau de Parfum,Serge Lutens," Each release of Serge Lutens' Palais-Royale exclusives into the export line is an eagerly awaited event and with this season's Cuir Mauresque, aficionados will, at last, be able to revel in the definitive Oriental leather, in the line of Caron's mythical Tabac Blond with spices added.This isn't the tough, rawhide pungency rising from Marrakech tanneries, but the smoothest, fatty-rich leather rubbed in flowers and a sweet spice blend of cinnamon, nutmeg, cumin and clove infused with the fragrant smoke of incense and myrrh rising from censers. Sweetened by orange blossom, mandarin peel and amber, Cuir Mauresque gives off a tawny, ember-like glow. The leather accord itself is produced by burnt styrax, a balsamic material with tarry, animalic facets; clove, incense and aloe wood add a dark, burnt edginess to the accord, while civet pulls it towards the animal.With its spiced dried fruit accord, resins and white flowers, Cuir Mauresque, originally launched in 1996, is perhaps the quintessential Lutens: the master himself has gone on record saying he doused himself in on the rare occasions when he goes out.  And considering the choice he's got, that's saying quite a lot. What We Think Spicy, powdery, and animalic, this is a delightfully sexy secret weapon of a fragrance."," amber, myrrh, burnt styrax, incense, cinnamon, aloe wood, cedar, civet, nutmeg, clove, cumin, musk, mandarin peel, orange blossom",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36140.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, amber
Tubereuse Criminelle Eau de Parfum,Serge Lutens," At last, Serge Lutens' mythical TubÃ©reuse Criminelle makes a break from the Palais Royal in this season's limited edition!Its surprisingly addictive minty-camphoraceous top notes are due to the Tiger Balm-ish smell of methyl salicylate, a molecule naturally present in the tuberose... Instead of taming their fierceness, Serge Lutens asked the perfumer Christopher Sheldrake to unleash it. But after this olfactory assault, the tuberose opens up its creamy heart, made richer still with its white floral sisters jasmine and orange blossom, contrasted with the green-rosy, indolic notes of hyacinth. A rich oriental base anchors it to the skin, the styrax underlining the almost leathery undertones of the tuberose, nutmeg and clove boosting its slow burn...Thus, the diva of the garden lives up to her reputation: first a slap, then a kiss... The rest, we'll leave entirely up to you. What We Think A dynamically minty take on tuberose for all the camphor lovers out there."," tuberose, jasmine, orange blossom, hyacinth, nutmeg, clove, styrax, musk, vanilla.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36151.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, tuberose
Serge Noire Eau de Parfum - ...,Serge Lutens," A phoenix, the mythical bird of legend burns at the height of its splendour before emerging triumphant, reborn from the ashes in a choreography of flame, conjuring the shapes of yesterday in a dance of ashes. The swirls of oriental grey enrich the twilight with depth and intensity while windswept memories hint at the beauty of transformation.An ode to everlasting beauty under cover of night's rich plumage. What We Think This enchantingly spicy and dark stunner is perfect for men or women who love cinnamon and clove (both feature players here) but don't want to smell like dessert."," patchouli, cinnamon, amber and black woods",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36122.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, patchouli
Sorong Eau de Parfum,"Pierre Guillaume Paris, Parfumerie Generale"," Inspired by the smooth, contemplative smoke of olibanum incense and the bright, luminous smoke of Indonesian kyara wood oud chips, Sorong is a grand vision of a mystical plane where the spiritual and supernatural collide. Centered around the ""animalized smoke"" accord created by this awe-inspiring combination- woody and spicy, with deep tones of amber- Sorong leads off with an energizing burst of citrus, spice, and blackcurrant, immediately elevating the fragrance with an airy yet substantial jolt of sophisticated energy and setting the stage for the vividly smoky, yet ultra-refined heart notes. Together, the potency of these materials is undeniable, and yet the effect is soothing, lending the wearer an aura of deep calm and protection. As it dries, a smouldering sexiness reasserts itself in the form of ambered musks which coax the animalism from the oud and incense with undeniable power. Like kyara itself, Sorong is a rare treasure, and a fragrance to savor."," Citrus, saffron, blackcurrant, kyara, olibanum, amber, animalic musks",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/34555.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, citrus
Chronic Eau de Parfum,19-69," ""In 1996, California became the first state in the US to legalize medical cannabis. But scratch the surface and there has always been a long history of cannabis cultivators and enthusiasts dedicating their lives to refining the herb. Chronic is a term for Cannabis and also alludes to 'The Chronic' - the debut album of Dr Dre. The Chronic was released in 1992, the same year as the Los Angeles riots."" -Johan BergerlinEye-openingly fresh, soothingly green, numbingly sticky- Chronic is everything a Cali weed scent should be. But rather than a straightforward reproduction of a bag of trees- after all, we can already get that out here- Chronic is a delightfully artistic reconstruction of the experience- from the sharply bitter citrus of the opening, to the dank green herbaceousness of clary sage, to a smokey twinge of vetiver. There's a naturalistic cannabis note in here too, but it emerges towards the end, bringing each note that preceded it together in a grand bouquet of, well, dankness. Take it from us- Chronic is the real stuff."," Petitgrain, bitter orange, bitter grapefruit, Russian clary sage, Virginian cedarwood, cannabis accord, amber, patchouli, vetiver, cashmere wood, moss, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/812006.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, petitgrain
Chinese Tobacco Eau de Parfum,19-69,"There are elements of different legendary movies like Indochine in the fragrance Chinese Tobacco. A reflection of East meets West taking place in the 30's to 50's colonial French Indochina. I'm often captured by these strong contrasts and different ambiances when travelling in Asia. The old and the new. A major influence for the scent was the powerful scene in the movie Apocalypse Now featuring Aurore Clement and Martin Sheen smoking opium. -Johan BergelinExotic, hypnotic, and more than a little dangerous, Chinese Tobacco is not your typically buttoned-up European tobacco scent. Fiery red pepper and coriander ignite the senses, while incense and oud add unexpected subtlety and a gently narcotic haze. Spicy and woodsy, primal and modern, Chinese Tobacco is a gripping study of East meets West."," Bergamot, Tobacco, Red Pepper, Lemon, Ginger, Coriander, Incense, Cedarwood, Vanilla, Tar, Oud, Vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/812002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
L'air Barbes Eau de Parfum,19-69," ""I was in my teens when I first discovered Helmut NewtonÂ´s picture that made YSLÂ´s Le Smoking iconic. The genderlessness really made a big impression on me. With stark monochrome simplicity, Newton created a piece of iconography I still find myself influenced by. In the making of LÂ´air BarbÃ¨s I was strongly influenced by the androgyny in this picture."" -Johan BergelinCold and fresh, L'Air Barbes is a tribute to Paris, capital de la mode. Evocative of Paris' different personas such as the concrete alleyways, le banlieue and the area BarbÃ¨s-Rochechouart, the fragrance sings of chilled aldehydes, wet stone, and smooth, rich orris. Modern, yet timeless, just like the City of Lights itself."," Aldehydes, Fresh Lemon, Bergamot, Concrete, Ylang Ylang, Tuberose, Ambroxan, Orris, Cumin Seeds, Ink, Leather, Dry Woods, White Musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/812005.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, aldehydes
Gris Clair Eau de Parfum,Serge Lutens," Gris Clair, Lutens's ode to lavender, evokes in our minds the image of a cool flame...a strange, otherworldly flame that illuminates but doesn't warm and doesn't burn if you touch it. The wonderfully refined, complex and beautifully ethereal creation beings with a chilly, shimmery, definitelygray lavender note. The contrast of the cold lavender and the sweeter, warmer blend of amber and tonka bean in the middle stage is incredibly appealing. Our favorite part of Gris Clair are the elegantly charred, smoky base notes of dry wood andburned incense. The darker accord gives Gris Clair an infinite depth and the exotic, opulent feel that we came to associate with the best Lutens's creations. The chilly lavender, the honeyed amber, the gently smoldering ashes of precious woods and incense create a unique, harmonious and striking, fusion of darkness and luminosity. Absolutely exquisite."," lavender, amber, tonka bean, iris, dry wood, incense",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36119.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, lavender
Bleu Satin Eau de Parfum,Parfums MDCI," Inspired by Thomas Gainsborough's famous The Blue Boy, Bleu Satin is a bright, fresh, exuberantly fruit-forward celebration of a scent, sure to appeal to lovers of fruity masculine scents everywhere. Impossibly juicy bergamot and electric green notes open the scent in full swing, while a deliciously fruity heart really separates Bleu Satin from its cohort, with sweet, intoxicating cassis and mouthwatering watermelon set against a hypnotically lush jasmine- fresh and elegant in equal measure. Finally, a base of gently-spiced leather lends longevity without sacrificing the vibrant spirit of the scent.

Chameleon Eau de Parfum,Zoologist," Like the luminescent skin of a reptile, fiery scales of sunlight ripple across the surface of the Indian Ocean, fading slowly to gold and finally sapphire as the sun sinks and disappears. The sea exhales, its gentle tide caressing the beach of an island paradise. The salty breath combines with the narcotic aromas of the ylang and frangipani trees in an intimate kiss, sending shivers through the branches. Something stirs  an eye pivots, a tail grips a slender bough. Will the creature vanish among the leaves, or flirt with a daring display of colour? No one knows. The secrets that lie beneath the skin of the chameleon keep Madagascar guessing. What we do know, however, is that Zoologist Chameleon is a deliciously elusive blend of bright florals, hypnotic musks, and exotic fruit that can turn the wearer into anything they want to be. Madagascar, home to half of the world's species of chameleons, holds the key to Zoologist Chameleon. Like the kaleidoscope of hues that swirl within the flesh of these exotic creatures, ylang dances with delicate frangipani upon your skin in a melody of creamy florals, while aphrodisiac vanilla blends with salty, silky musks to envelop you in the fruity, exotic atmosphere of the island. Whether you desire to shroud yourself in an air of mystery, or blatantly flaunt your true colours, Chameleon becomes you."," Bergamot, Lemon, Madagascar Ylang Ylang, Mango, Pink Pepper, Star Fruit, Violet Leaves, Cashmeran, Clove, Coconut, Frangipani, Jasmine, Saffron, Salty Skin Accord, Sea Breeze, Amber, Woods, Musks, Opoponax, Patchouli, Sandalwood, Vanilla, Vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76023.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot

A blindingly fresh burst of bergamot-led citrus dazzles the senses, building into a perfectly blended, gently sweet floral heart that deftly balances lavender, rose, and iris against the still-present citrus for an unforgettable yet oh-so-easy-to-wear combination that lingers for hours, while a gentle base of ambery sandalwood soothes and relaxes without ever feeling overly warm or heavy. Enticing, romantic, sophisticated and outright fun, Scent Of Paradise is truly a citrus lover's dream: spray it on, close your eyes, and allow yourself to be carried away."," Bergamot, fruity notes, iris, rose, lavender, amber, musk, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/81004.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
From The Heart Extrait de Parfum,Alghabra Parfums," Inspired by the lush beauty of the traditional Arab-Islamic courtyard house and the many fruits and flowers that flourished there in the days of Old Damascus, From The Heart is a thoroughly lovely and joyful scent. Like the traditional bitter orange trees that spread their distinctively fresh aroma through the courtyard, From The Heart opens bright and citrussy, with a lusciously sweet fruitiness from peach and ylang. At the core of the scent, a fully blooming flower garden exudes lush romanticism from the exquisite damask rose, as well as the full-bodied, sensual freshness of lily, all warmed by a subtle ambered base. Like the warm summer air wafting through the stately courtyard, From The Heart is an exuberant expression of freshness that lingers in the memory."," Bergamot, bitter orange, damask rose, lily, peach, ylang ylang, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/81000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
King Of Flowers Extrait de Parfum,Alghabra Parfums," In the Old City of Damascus, the narrow streets and ancient alleyways carry a dizzying, magical array of scents: fresh flowers from the marketplace, mouthwatering treats emerging hot from bakery ovens, exotic spices from bubbling pots in local kitchens. Taken together, these are the smells of a timeless community, and their indelible memory is the essence of King Of Flowers, a richly evocative extrait from Alghabra. Opening fresh, green, and citrussy, the composition soon deepens as the titular white flowers, warm and sensual, blossom in the heart of the fragrance against a smooth, creamy vanilla. A sophisticated touch of ambered leather makes us pause to think of the many travelers that have ventured these ancient streets- perhaps they, too, stopped to marvel at the wondrous combination of aromas on the warm summer breeze. If so, King Of Flowers would surely transport them back just as it does for us. A magical, whimsical, unforgettable scent."," Bergamot, grapefruit, amber, vanilla, white flowers, lavender, sandalwood, leather, iris",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/81001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Poem Of Damas Extrait de Parfum,Alghabra Parfums," If the notes list for Poem Of Damas seems a little vague, don't fret: you'll know exactly what you're smelling when you experience it, which is to say that Poem of Damas is one of the most straightforwardly confident, lush, downright gorgeous rose-oud scents we've ever encountered. Featuring an exquisite floral bouquet supplemented with the finest agarwood extract available on the market, Poem Of Damas seems to forego the traditional fragrance structure: the rich, dark, smooth oud explodes off the skin from the first spray, soon met with a lusciously rich Damascene rose, warm, romantic and completely captivating. Gently ambered tones of fruit and spice wax and wane throughout the life of the scent, sanding every rough edge and deepening the intense sophistication of the composition, which manages to feel hypnotically seductive and warmly comforting all at once, with a glow that lingers for untold hours. Simply put? This is rose oud as it was meant to be experienced."," Rose, floral notes, fruity notes, amber, oud, oriental notes",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/81002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, rose

This is the inspiration of Boha, an intensely lovely gardenia-led white floral that radiates sublimity and yet surrounds the wearer in provocation. Like staring into the sun, we open with the blinding freshness of electrically bright bergamot and bitingly green almond. As we adjust to the light, we bask in the sheer beauty of gardenia, romantic and opulent, blended perfectly with sweet orange blossom and lush jasmine.

Patiala Extrait,Thameen," Created by Cartier in 1928 for an Indian Maharaja, the Patiala Necklace is an impossibly opulent piece of jewelry at the center of an unsolved mystery.  Containing 2,390 diamonds, the necklace disappeared in 1948, only to have bits and pieces reappear at various auctions over the years without explanation. To this day, the disappearance has never been explained. In this spirit of opulence and mystery, Thameen presents Patiala, a shimmering and sophisticated sweet floral too precious to misplace. Patiala opens with a head-spinning rush of energizing citrus and blinding aldehydes, sparkling with the intensity of its namesake's centerpiece 235 carat diamond. Yet it wears as comfortably as the necklace might around one who could afford it, with a rich, lush heart of orange flower and rose that anoints the bearer as royalty. A sweet, musky amber glows for countless hours, bathing us in serene reflected light. The original Patiala Necklace has sadly been lost to mystery, never to be experienced in its original glory again. But with this Patiala, we have a pretty good sense of just how it must have felt to experience such luxurious beauty."," Citrus, aldehyde, orange flower, rose, moss, amber, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/73421.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, citrus

1900 L'Heure de Proust Eau de Parfum,Les Bains Guerbois," 1900, the height of La Belle Epoque. Legendary author Marcel Proust and a cherished confidante retire to the bains sulfureux for a day of elaborate pampering- steam, massage, and a grand tea service to while away the private hours. The delicacies enjoyed in these intimate moments make up the magical scent of 1900 L'Heure de Proust. Our service begins with the exquisite fruits used to flavour the tea, tart, bright grapefruit and lusciously juicy blueberry, set against the smoky richness of pure black tea and the refined leather upholstering the private couch to where our subjects have retired. The unisex freshness of violet perfumes the wood-panelled room, while a tray of mouthwatering desserts- sweet pralines and creamy vanilla cake- beckon our indulgence. The scent is gorgeous, delightful, masculine and feminine intertwined- far from scandalous, but equally far from innocent. Indeed, when naming a scent for Proust, the bar is raised- and we're delighted to say that 1900 L'Heure de Proust is evocative enough to inspire a masterpiece of your own."," Bergamot, blueberry, grapefruit, violet, black tea, Tuscan leather, mate, gaiac, praline, vanilla, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/79708.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Sweet Flowers Eau de Parfum,Montale," Sweet and fresh, fresh and sweet... so often in perfume, we find one at the expense of the other, resigned to the idea that what makes our mouths water and what makes our hearts flutter are mutually exclusive.

Bakhoor,Montale," Born from the ancient traditions of nomadic tribes of the Middle East, a Bakhoor is a unique take on fragrant smoke- a wood chip soaked in a special recipe- different for each person- of scented oils and resins and slowly burned in a vessel known as a Mabkhara. The resulting scent- no two identical, but always rich, smoky, sweet, woodsy- is thought to purify, relax, and even treat traditional maladies. As a perfume, Bakhoor draws on the long history of this tradition, delivering a raw, exotic scent that feels equally contemplative and seductive, rich in resin, sandalwood, oud, and leather. For those who love smoky, sophisticated, sensual scents with a touch of the out-of-ordinary- don't miss Bakhoor."," Oud, saffron, tanned leather, cedarwood, vetiver, sandalwood, grey amber, white musk, gaiac",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/354006.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, oud
Leather Patchouli Eau de Parfum,Montale," Let's get one thing clear- Leather Patchouli is not a gourmand scent. After all, it more than delivers on its titular promise, delivering a rich, robust oriental with deep tones of earthy patchouli and smooth, masculine leather. You'd be forgiven for not realizing it on first sniff, though, as Leather Patchouli combines all the complimentary notes you might expect- labdanum, oud, cedarwood- with a delectable blend of white musk, vanilla, and saffron, balancing the richness of the main ingredients with a smooth sweetness that accentuates the natural gourmand aspects of the patchouli without ever venturing into ""sugar syrup"" territory. The result is a dynamic scent, rugged enough to satisfy the most macho of tastes, but smooth enough to sport with the most elegant of evening wear."," Leather, labdanum, oud, patchouli, cedar, sandalwood, saffron, ambergris, white musk, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/354007.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, leather
Mefisto Gentiluomo Eau de Parfum,Xerjoff - Casamorati," Mefisto Gentiluomo is, as the name suggests, a gentleman's cologne, composed in the style of the eaux de cologne used in upscale barbershop joints in Italy circa 1888. Like its progenitor, Mefisto, Gentiluomo takes what seems to have become a dirty word in perfumery  clean  and makes it sexy again. Think the steamy aromas in a traditional Italian barbershop after a shave  triple-milled soap, plush white towels, $500 handmade leather loafers, and the sweet creaminess of sandalwood lotion massaged into warm skin. Yes, Gentiluomo wins the day by being gorgeously, luxuriously clean without leaning on cheap musks or powder.Right off the bat, Mefisto Gentiluomo playfully updates its predecessor's model by brushing its bright, salty citrus notes with icy mint and a burst of bitter green leaves. It wows on the basis of just how natural and mouth-wateringly fresh it smells. Salty lavender lends a subtle ozonic feel  not marine or aquatic per se, but rather a hillside of leathery herbs brushed by sea air. We're impressed with the bubble of sweetness that floats up here, a slightly candied citrus or lavender note that serves to balance out the sharper notes, giving it a polished, modern vibe. But if Mefisto Gentiluomo starts out in the maquis of a Mediterranean hillside, and lingers in the luxuriantly bright, clean atmosphere of a traditional barbershop, it ultimately comes to rest in the milieu of a Florentine artisan's workshop, where the scent of suede mingles companionably with the patina of centuries-old wood. The flowers contribute only a softness of texture, but the iris stands out, bathing the aromatics in its spectral glow. Handsome, refined, and full of Italian braggadocio, Mefisto Gentiluomo is a fresh barbershop fougere with a hidden creamy floral-citrus core that pulls it out of 1888 and right into 2018."," bergamot, lavender, lemon, grapefruit, iris, rose, violet, amber, cedar wood, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/67414.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Uden Overdose Parfum,Xerjoff," Who says perfection can't be improved upon? Though the name Uden Overdose implies that this scent is simply a stronger version of the original Uden, this scent has a distinct personality of its own and deserves to be taken on its own terms. How does it differ, you ask? Well, while Uden Overdose retains the wonderfully aromatic brightness of the original  the essence of its fougere' character - it swaps out the gourmand creaminess of Uden's booze, vanilla, and lavender for the dry toastiness of spice, hay, and woody ambers. Both are utterly charming in their different ways. But if original Uden is a fougere you feel tempted to eat, Uden Overdose is a fougere you want to roll around in, like you would in piles of new mown hay.  Uden Overdose opens similarly to Uden, burning comet bright with the aromatic sharpness of bergamot and lemon. But while original Uden turns creamy with vanilla, Uden Overdose steers immediately into a dry, spicy track, a blaze of ginger root giving the citrus a thrillingly hot and dirty underbite. Think a tannic Earl Grey tea liberally spiked with grated ginger. It smells masculine, clean, and above all, dry, with nary a hint of sugar or cream around the edges. Tobacco blossom plays a central role in Uden Overdose, its green hay-like tones giving the gingery citrus tea a rustic edge reminiscent of herbs and wildflowers baking under a hot sun. Woody ambers and musks are applied with judicious restraint in the base, thickening and sweetening the scent but never disturbing the smooth, aromatic flow of the scent's trajectory. This one's such a pleasure to wear. If you love fougeres (and the original Uden) but want a woodsy, spicy take that gives you plenty of options, then Uden Overdose is your man."," Bergamot, lemon, ginger, tobacco blossom, amber, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/51151.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Colognise Extrait de Cologne,Nishane," In Turkey, houseguests are often greeted with a splash of bright, fresh lemon cologne on the hands, a traditional gesture of hospitality that both disinfects and leaves a vibrant, if short-lived scent. With Colognise, Nishane, a house well-known for rich, long-lasting extraits, takes this beloved custom and modernizes it into a dynamic, sexy, wonderfully easy-to-wear ""extrait de cologne""- a concentration that captures all of the vibrance and exuberance of a traditional citrus cologne, in a much longer-lasting 18% concentration. On first spray, Colognise positively explodes with bright, fresh lemon and bergamot, a fitting tribute to the simple, beautiful lemon colognes of its inspiration- but even in the opening, a smooth, beautiful green tea note hints at the greater complexity that lies ahead. Soon, an rich, emerging floral heart of lily and jasmine adds dimensionality and lush, unisex character, even as the citrus continues to sparkle. A sweet, grassy vetiver and soft musk further enrich the depth and romanticism, feeling modern and classic all at once. Created in the spirit of hospitality, Colognise is so very effortless to wear that you'll have to decide whether to share it with everyone- or keep it all for yourself."," Bergamot, lemon, green tea, jasmine, grapefruit, muguet, vetiver, neroli, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77451.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Mulholland Eau de Parfum,Keiko Mecheri," A citrus-drenched ode to the summer of love in Laurel Canyon. - Imagine bare feet, jangling bracelets and an acoustic guitar strumming in the background. This is a big, bright citrus, bathed in hazy California sunshine. Smooth sandalwood and rich amber provide a warm, sensuous, golden base, and a hint of patchouli gives it all a little something extra  because it wouldn't be canyon living without a little patchouli in the mix, would it?  The powerful base notes match the brightness of the citrus, resulting in an exceptionally attractive and well-balanced scent that captures California dreamin' perfectly."," Citrus, petit grain, hint of patchouli, sandalwood, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/16461.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, citrus
Irisistible Eau de Parfum,April Aromatics," How do you describe a scent when its own name says it all? Irisistible, by far April Aromatics' most ambitious scent yet, is a powerhouse of floral beauty, a showcase for a divine collection of rare and expensive natural materials sure to make toes curl with pleasure. At the center is an exquisite, unforgettable Italian iris pallida, the single most exclusive material ever used in a Tanja Bochnig creation, a buttery, iridescent, rooty floral with exceptional fidelity, laid down into a lush, vibrant bed of equally gorgeous supporting notes: the sparkling brightness of Italian lemon, the narcotic sensuality of Indian tuberose and jasmine, the romantic fullness of Bulgarian rose, and the fiery cinnamon spice of Sri Lankan cassia. The combination is something beyond beautiful, achieving a blissfully full-bodied lusciousness that, in true April Aromatics fashion, sidesteps the stereotypes of natural perfumery to evoke grand, romantic fragrances of bygone eras. Sure, we might have said this fragrance was impossible to describe, but once we experienced the first spritz on skin, well- we simply couldn't resist."," Lemon, iris, jasmine, rose, tuberose, cassia, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/65816.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, lemon
Kolonya Eau de Toilette,Rasei Fort," Inspired by Rasei Fort's earliest childhood memories of time with his grandfather- his garden of blooming jasmine and lemon trees, the classic eau de cologne faded into his crisply starched shirt- Kolonya is an intensely personal scent, a true labor of love that echoes with the warmth of pleasantly fuzzy recollection. An imposing list of notes- citrus, spice, florals, moss, woods, resins- nonetheless coalesces into a hypnotically soothing whole, a smooth chord progression of gently wistful etherea that sits softly on the skin, yet will surprise you with moments of profound recognition throughout the day. Not so much a cologne as the memory of a cologne, Kolonya is more than mere fragrance- it's genuine emotion, captured on skin.Please note: Kolonya is a splash style bottle."," Bergamot, Neroli, Petitgrain, Clove, Nutmeg, White Pepper, Bitter Orange, Pink Grapefruit, Blood Orange, Rosewood, Orange Blossom, Rose, Coriander, Galbanum, Rosemary, Jasmine, Ylang Ylang, Geranium, Lavender, Angelica Root, Black Plum, Indian Vetiver, Oakmoss, Hay, Amber, Benzoin, Sandalwood, Virginian Cedarwood, Musk, Tobacco",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/80800.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Oud for Greatness Eau de Parfum,Initio Parfums," The concept ofsacred geometry,  the inspiration behind Oud For Greatness,  is that recurring symbols and motifs- including the sacred scent of oud- are so powerful and holy that they are imbued with these hidden connections to the world at large,  transcending the material plane to align those who smell it with the vibrations of the universe. In other words,  experiencing the true scent of oud is a tonic for physical,  emotional,  and spiritual health. With Oud For Greatness,  Initio taps into that hidden source of power,  delivering a vibrant,  sensual,  richly spicy fragrance deeply imbued with oud from beginning to end. It's a highly concentrated blend of pure,  natural agarwood oil and natural oud wood,  a rich accord that melds the dark,  spicy,  sweet,  and smoky characteristics of this precious substance into an impossibly complex elixir,  both energetic and contemplative,  narcotic and seductive. An additional burst of savory spice comes by way of a rich blend of saffron and nutmeg,  while bright lavender pushes it towards the sexy and masculine- though make no mistake,  this scent is devastatingly sexy on men and women alike. While it might seem inexact to say that a fragrance offers something for everyone,  we don't know how else to describe Oud For Greatness- we suppose a perfume this in tune with the hidden patterns of the world ought to smell this downright incredible."," Lavender, Saffron, Nutmeg, Natural Oud Wood, Natural Agarwood oil, Patchouli, Muscs",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/802005.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, lavender

Hyde Eau de Parfum,Hiram Green Perfumes," A venomously enchanting potion to turn the meek into monsters, Hyde is an unforgettably dark and smoky leather spiked with bolts of green, spicy florals. A flash of bright citrus marks the start of the transformation, and is quickly overtaken with a sensually sinister smokiness that fills the senses and floods the imagination. As your perception adjusts, the intensity of the smoke makes way for the subtleties that lie within, courtesy of the Cassie flower, a unique relative of mimosa with distinctly spicy and fresh green characteristics. But Hyde is a beastly fragrance through and though, and even as the complexity grows, complete with resinous labdanum and smooth, malted vanilla, the overall effect is captivatingly dark, intensely powerful, and wholly unforgettable. Let the power of Hyde transform you, but be warned- there may be no turning back."," Lemon, bergamot, birch tar, acacia, cistus labdanum, malt, vanilla, oakmoss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/68106.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, lemon
Noir Encens Eau de Parfum,Mad et Len," Noir Encens is based on the scent of Mad et Len's beautiful Noir Encens potpourri  little nuggets of resin and wood soaked with frankincense essential oils  as well as the smoky, balsamic incense of an earlier release, the 2010 No. XLIII Encens. The 2018 Noir Encens takes the austere frankincense oil of the original and thickens it up with powdery tonka bean, velvety amber, and the rich booziness of amaretto, thus replacing High Mass with the coziness of a fireside on a cold winter's night, book in hand and cat on lap. The almondy heft of the tonka bean is both bitter in the cherry-amaretto sense of bitter and sweet in the marzipan sense of sweet - so perfectly balanced that you're never quite sure whether you're smelling the poison or the cure. One thing is for sure, though: Noir Encens is far more sensual than any incense scent has a right to be. Smelling it triggers both the desire to hibernate and to bite into someone's neck, so be careful. If you're driven to distraction by the balsamic, smoky, nigh on edible sexiness of fragrances such as FÃ¨ve DÃ©licieuse by Dior PrivÃ©e, Hypnotic Poison by Dior, or Le Baiser du Dragon by Cartier, then you can't afford to miss out on Mad et Len's 2018 Noir Encens."," amber, frankincense, tonka bean",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/75225.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, amber
Changing Constance Eau de Parfum,Penhaligons," Sister to Lady Blanche, Constance is what one would call a very modern woman. Her opening blend of cool cardamom and hot pimento is modern, to say the least, and is bound to deliver a dynamically fresh and spicy thrill. Still possessing a mild affinity to her favourite childhood treat, Constance can always be found sucking on a butter salted caramel as she twirls her Turkish cigar, clad in perfectly tailored cashmere trousers. Irreverent, stylish, and unquestionably contemporary, Changing Constance isn't a fragrance for every woman, which is assuredly exactly the way she likes it."," Cardamom, pimento, salted butter, caramel, tobacco, vanilla, cashmeran",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/441025.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, cardamom
And The World Is Yours Extrait de Parfum,A Lab on Fire," Few photographs capture the sumptuousness of celebrity more than the iconic photograph of Faye Dunaway by famed English photographer Terry O'Neill. The starlet sits poolside at the Beverly Hills Hotel at 6 a.m., hungover from winning an Oscar, sanguine in a pale silk robe, newspapers in a moat around her feet declaring her victor. And who better to pay homage to this most Hollywood morning-after, but Dominique Ropion, master of the doe-eyed and disheveled A Lab On Fire classics What We Do In Paris Is Secret and Messy Sexy Just Rolled Out Of Bed?And the World Is Yours kicks off with a blast of neroli that floods the senses, rich and fresh with the thrilling energy of a papparazzo's flashbulb. With a dramatic sigh, the neroli gives way to a warm, creamy orange blossom, enhanced with a flattering kick of spice. Ropion's signature vanilla musk plays its part with a powdery puff of heliotropeapropos for the Hollywood sensuality. And just like the shimmering sunsets of Los Angeles, it melts into a honeyed, musky, golden finish. Like Dunaway in the photograph, And the World Is Yours is stylish, sexy- and still basking in the afterglow of last night's adventures."," Neroli, cumin, orange blossom absolute, rose, heliotrope, sandalwood, vanilla pod CO2,  tonka absolute, tolu balsam",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/56716.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, neroli
L'Heure Exquise 2020 Extrait de Parfum,Bortnikoff," Spring in Paris has almost become summer today. The shades of evening begin to descend. You sit in a cafe in the city center and look at the Seine. The sun goes down and the colors of the day mix with the purple sky. The familiar outlines of objects are faded by pastel tones, your eyes rest, and your feelings become stronger. The waiter brings you a cup of cocoa and a dessert. Dusky air cools your face and you feel the richness of scents brighter than ever before: the beverage, the food and a bouquet of flowers nearby. It is L'heure Exquise. The fragrance starts with a soft mix of Cardamom and Citruses. In a moment you get into a whirlpool of spicy notes of Cocoa, Clove and Myrrh. The heart of the fragrance beats with floral notes of exotic Champaca and Jasmine. Indonesian and Vietnamese Oud, Tolu Balsam and delicate White Amber are warming the beautiful base of the fragrance.Same formula, new 2020 batch with a re-worked, smoother Oud accord"," Bergamot, neroli, cardamom, champaca, champaca leaf, jasmine, attar motia, cedar, cacao, clove, camphor, nagarmotha, myrrh, Vietnamese oud roots, Indonesian oud, styrax, tolu balsam, ambergris",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/804003.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Noble XXI Cypress Parfum,Clive Christian," Clive Christian Cypress is a beautifully-made masculine that manages to capture the magic of a French Riviera night, where the spicy greenness of the breeze sweeping through tall cypress trees mingles with the effervescence of freshly-poured champagne. Think F. Scott Fitzgerald and Zelda boozing it up in a citrus grove in Nice, the tinkle of laughter and light jazz floating on the warm night air, and that's the mood board right there for the scent. The opening to Cypress is surprisingly spicy, thick with cloves, cinnamon, ginger root, and the anisic mintiness of fresh basil. But it's also immensely fresh and sour, a lively undercurrent of tart bergamot playing off the green bitterness of cypress. Fans of the balsamic soapiness of Jaipur Homme will recognize echoes in Cypress, but where the Boucheron burrows deep into an opoponax base, Cypress swerves into an elegant essay on the dry richness of woods. In the base, a handsome pairing of oakwood and cedarwood knits together a rich weave of smoke, toasted wood, and spice until you can't tell where one ends and the other begins. In the far reaches of the scent, rich amber swells up to thicken the woods, adding weight but not sweetness. If anyone is feeling short-changed by the dearth in good masculines these days, then point them in the direction of Clive Christian Cypress  they won't be disappointed."," petitgrain, bergamot, basil, cypress, clove, ginger, nutmeg, amber, oakwood, cedar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/58023.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, petitgrain
Champ de Fleurs Eau de Cologne,L'Artisan Parfumeur," Anne Flipo revisits of one of her most influential perfumes: 1999's La Chasse Aux Papillons. An impossibly soft, transparent tuberose that spells out spring in capital letters. In Champ de Fleurs, Flipo keeps the airy white floral in place, but takes it in a new and interesting direction. First, she freshens the topnotes with bitter grapefruit and a juicy pear note, giving the floral heart an icy morning dew' feel. Second, perhaps more significantly, she bolsters the airy tuberose with a creamy, full-fat pairing of gardenia and jasmine, so that the contrast between the fresh eau de cologne-style notes in the opening and the buttery floral heart feels even more dramatic. Velvety, creamy, and hovering somewhere between suggestive and innocent, Champ de Fleurs lingers on the skin and in the air for hours. It melts into the muskiness of your own skin, forming an aura that will leave people wondering if you're perfumed or have just been luxuriating in a long, steamy bath with honey and milk soap. Like La Chasse Aux Papillons and Chanel Beige, Champ de Fleurs is suggestive of springtime meadows but in an abstract, impressionistic way  you smell the gardenia, the tuberose, and the crisp green muguet not as a living, breathing flower per se, but as a gently creamy floral watercolor that swirls all the colors together. Unabashedly feminine, we see Champ de Fleurs as the perfect choice for those who prefer a discreetly luxurious symphony of spring flowers over the loud, fleshy sexiness of a tuberose or gardenia solo."," grapefruit, pear, jasmine, lily of the valley, cedar, musk, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/152022.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, grapefruit
Forty Thieves Eau de Parfum,Fort & Manle," From dusk til dawn,  a vast desert land, Camel caravans through the golden sand. Among the Bedouins they would retreat,   Surrounded by tea,  spices and delicacies to eat.A warm breeze carries the incense smoke,   Laughter around the shisha as they joke.  At nightfall,  they return to their coveted treasure,  Hidden in a cave,  it's a sight of pleasure.Open Sesame,  enter if you please,  To the mystical tale of the Forty Thieves.The latest in Fort & Manle's stunning slate of gorgeous,  idiosyncratic fragrances,  Forty Thieves is a sweet,  lush,  mouthwatering gem of a scent that weaves as dashing a tale as the original legend of Ali Baba himself. Vivid bursts of juicy bergamot and crackling pink pepper evoke the swirling oasis of the legendary hidden cave,  while a richly resinous floral heart suggests the untold treasures that lay within. A robustly balsamic base boasts sensusal warmth,  combining the comfort of vanilla with the deep mysteries of oud,  resulting in the unique balance of delightful wearability and utter originality that seems to distinguish every Fort & Manle scent. At the risk of overstating the theme,  Forty Thieves is undeniably worth its weight in gold."," Bergamot, pink pepper, petitgrain, incense, labdanum, papyrus, rose, honey, orange blossom, amber, sandalwood, oud, vanilla, balsam",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/78119.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Dark Lord Eau de Parfum,By Kilian," Dangerously sophisticated, Dark Lord is both a fragrance of impeccable manners and seductive wickedness. It's a scent for gentlemen and scoundrels alike, both bold and subtle, constructed around a rich, gorgeous extract of raw Haitian vetiver and an intriguing blend of fruit-inflected, bright Sichuan pepper and electric bourbon pepper, smoothed behind a refined facade of leather and rum. Each supporting note- spicy, sweet, boozy, smooth, and earthy- coaxes out a corresponding facet of the vetiver, resulting in a men's fragrance with impressive versatility- in an office, worn with a sensible suit, it exudes suave, dignified elegance, while simultaneously adding a dangerous allure to a night out on the town- exactly what Kilian Hennessy had in mind from the beginning. Sure, you're just a regular, mild-mannered guy- but with a dash of Dark Lord, you can be so much more."," Bergamot, sichuan pepper, bourbon pepper, davana, rum, jasmine, vetiver, cypriol, cedar, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/425200.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Love Tuberose Eau de Parfum,Amouage," Are you on a diet? Well, sorry, because Love Tuberose is destined to weaken your resolve. Amouage's second installment in its Secret Garden' series is an outrageously gourmand take on one of nature's most hot-headed blooms: tuberose. Eschewing all the green, vegetal, rubbery, and indolic facets normally associated with tuberose, Love Tuberose instead plays up all the creamiest, sweetest, and most buttery aspects of this sensuous flower until we arrive at a result that's less flower, more trÃ¨s leches cake. Picture this: layers upon layers of creamy white jasmine and tuberose petals soaked in condensed milk and pressed into a 10-layer white cake, bound together by an ethereal gardenia buttercream. Honestly, if you put this on and don't allow an involuntary groan of pleasure to escape your lips, then you're stronger than we are. The Chantilly cream note is delicious, its whipped creaminess blurring the indolic thrust of tuberose so that the flower becomes feather-soft and almost innocent. Love Tuberose turns the heat back on, though, with a salty, musky drydown that wears like a halo of salty gardenia, sun-kissed skin, and sandalwood. An unabashedly feminine scent, Love Tuberose's pearlescent ivory bottle is a perfect mirror of the frothy layers of tulle contained within. But would we deny a man a slice of white cake with buttercream frosting if he wanted it? No - this level of deliciousness deserves to be experienced by everyone."," tuberose, jasmine, gardenia, whipped cream, vanilla, sandalwood, cedar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/41894.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, tuberose
Percival Eau de Parfum,Parfums de Marly," Named for a mythical French thoroughbred, Percival is that rarest of wonders- a truly ageless masculine. Sure, we can picture a dashing racing horse thundering around an 18th century track to the delight of the aristocracy, but Percival is every bit as appropriate on a debonair gentleman in a pristine late-model luxury sedan, stylishly cutting his way through the bustling city night on his way to an exclusive gathering. With a subtle yet striking balance between citrus and aromatic notes, a richly masculine floral heart of lavender, violet and geranium, and a spiced, deeply woodsy base, this is the kind of scent that wears as perfectly on any man as an impeccably tailored three-piece suit- a timeless signifier of dignity and taste. Fresh, sensual and refined, Percival is bound to leave a lasting impression."," Bergamot, mandarin, aromatic notes, jasmine, violet, geranium, lavender, pink pepper, coriander, cinnamon, musk, woody notes, spices, pepper, nutmeg, tonka",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70027.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Lucid Dream Eau de Parfum,Ex Idolo," Lucid Dream is an olfactory exploration of the semi meditative state in which a person is aware they are asleep but is able to control their surroundings, and an ode to the potential hidden in every one of us. Juxtaposing rich, bright notes of pink pepper and davana with smoky, meditative florals and incense, Lucid Dream truly feels like another plane of existence, an ethereal journey into a world where we follow our wildest artistic impulses and break through the creative blocks that may impede our waking lives. It's a vivid, yet ethereal, experience, simultaneously romantic and contemplative, with the outstanding ingredient quality and rich tonalities for which Ex Idolo is known. Will Lucid Dream make you a master of your own subconscious? While we can't guarantee it, with a scent this wonderfully evocative, you'll certainly be inspired to find out."," Pink pepper, davana, smoky osmanthus, rose, incense, white patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/63702.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, pink pepper
Woody Mood Eau de Parfum,Olfactive Studio," With Woody Mood, perfumer Betrand Duchaufour reaches inside our head and pulls out all our fantasies of fall  crisp air, sweet woodsmoke, the crackle of leaves hitting the bonfire  compiling them into an autumnal essay that satisfies down to the bone. The inspiration for Woody Mood is Roger Steffens's 1973 photo of a woman wandering alone in a California redwood forest, shafts of sunlight piercing the gloom. Since Duchaufour is the father of perfume history's most influential woody-incense scents (Timbuktu, Avignon, etc.), it makes perfect sense that he was the perfumer chosen to translate the photo into fragrance form. Woody Mood opens with a buzz of whiskey-soaked wood, rich and wet, which quickly dries out into a ribbon of pure woodsmoke winding lazily through chill air. Aromatic sage and spikenard give the woods a masculine swagger, but we see this scent working beautifully on a woman's skin too. From the radiant blaze of woods emerges a core of rubbery black tea, cacao, and styrax, darkening the scent to the point where we're no longer sure whether we're smelling wood or leather. The contrast in Woody Mood between the peppery brightness of the woods and the darkness of burnt resin is a perfect mirror of the play of light on dark in the photo. Like Au Coeur du Desert, Woody Mood's genius lies in conjuring up a vivid chiaroscuro from a restricted palette of earth tones. If you love the radiant smokiness of woodsmoke without the additional weight of amber or cream, then this scent by Olfactive Studio is a no-brainer."," bergamot, ginger, clary sage, saffron, sequoia, spikenard (jatamansi), black tea, incense, patchouli, leather, styrax, cacao",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/61514.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Cuir Celeste Eau de Parfum,Ex Nihilo," Does artistic talent transcend its medium? That's the question posed by Ex Nihilo's bold new Visionnaire series, which explores the answer by pairing renowned visual artists with Ex Nihilo perfumers to help them shape their artistic conceptions into actual scents. For the premiere of the series, they've teamed Ex Nihilo house perfumer Quentin Bisch with acclaimed photographer Mathieu Cesar, and the result is Cuir Celeste, an arrestingly modern, surprisingly nuanced leather scent with all the vibrant contrast of a museum-quality B&W print. Cuir Celeste opens with a clean, dry violet leaf accentuated with the quiet energy of a restrained black pepper note. The leather accord here strikes a compelling balance between gentle ambrette-laced florals and bitter galbanum, with cypriol providing a rich, dry, papyrus-like base anchored to the spicy and woodsy tones of akigalawood. The effect is modern, smooth, and intriguing- a scent that doesn't so much mimic the actual aromas of photography so much as it smells the way a photograph looks- a representation of reality through the lens of a creator. If you love modern floral leather, don't miss Cuir Celeste- it's a work of art."," Black pepper, violet leaf, galbanum, ambrette, osmanthus, patchouli, cypriol, akigalawood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/72053.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, black pepper
EO No. 1 EdP Eau de Parfum,Ensar Oud," When Ensar released Sultan Leather Attar to overwhelming acclaim, he realized something- that even outside of his extraordinary pure oudh and sandalwood oils, fragrance connoisseurs were starving for rich, evocative blends that defy conventional trends. But to make an Eau de Parfum utilizing his unprecedented collection of exquisite natural materials, avoiding cheap, easy to use synthetics, was a major risk. Still, the people were calling out for an EDP. And now, here we are. And what does an all-natural Ensar Oud EDP smell like? We're sure you can imagine it involves oud and leather, and boy does it- a blend containing such jaw-dropping materials as bright, clean, powerful $2,500/3gr Kyaratul Mustafa oud oil, 13-year-aged wild Hainan sinensis extract, and precious, carefully aged rose oil from Sultan Qaboos's private collection. The results are wonderfully rich, the oud and leather sing of power and sophistication, the rose a perfectly lush counterpart adding  romantic depth. There's no barnyard funk to be found here, just the type of elegantly masculine warmth that a lady of style could also wear with aplomb. A luxurious flacon adorned with real, naturally tanned, pure full-grain Italian leather completes the vision. EDPs like this don't come around anymore- don't miss your chance to experience one."," rose, oud, leather, tobacco, tea",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/800014.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, rose
Tyrannosaurus Rex Extrait de Parfum,Zoologist," A sultry heat wafts across the land, lapped up greedily by the abundant flora that thrives in its midst. Trees soar to majestic heights and plants flower for the first time, their petals spreading to give birth to a world rich in diversity. The Cretaceous period comes of age against a backdrop scorched by wildfire and lightning strikes. Over this turbulent landscape, a massive predator looms. Giants rule the earth, but even giants can be cut down within the powerful jaws of the fearsome tyrannosaur. Standing tall, the terrifying beast fears nothing, until that pivotal moment when a fire in the sky signals the end of their deadly reign.Zoologist Tyrannosaurus Rex is a gargantuan scent that sinks its teeth into the world of delicate fragrances and rips it wide open. Primitive woods and florals seize you and snatch you away to an ancient era. Smoky, charred wood warns of the danger of smouldering fire, setting your senses on edge, while droplets of metallic rose oxide offer a chilling premonition of blood-lust. The mighty Tyrannosaurus Rex is sometimes menacing, sometimes fascinating, but never, ever ordinary."," Bergamot, black pepper, fir, laurel leaf, neroli, nutmeg, champaca, geranium, jasmine, osmanthus, rose, ylang, resins, cade, cedar, civet, frankincense, leather, patchouli, sandalwood, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76022.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Remember Me Eau de Parfum,Jovoy Paris," Remember Me is an olfactory aide-memoire of an inspiring trip to Qatar that perfumer Cecile Zarokian took with Jovoy founder, Francois Henin. While in Doha, Cecile fell in love with the scent of Karak, a local chai made with lots of lush, sweet milk, cardamom, and ginger, the steam of which mingled companionably with the exotic mukhallats and bakhoor she was sampling. Combined with wafts of frangipani coming from the shady avenues of Doha, Remember Me is a memory capsule of these exotic but comforting scents.  Combining edible elements like milk, vanilla, and chai with less edible notes such as leather and wood, Remember Me is a modern, sophisticated gourmand - it avoids making you think directly of food. Everything here is remarkably well balanced. The chai is peppery hot with ginger, but calmed by a generous pour of steamy milk and vanilla. In turn, the creaminess of the tea is kept fresh by a duo of bergamot and cardamom threaded through the scent like a tart green ribbon. You'd be forgiven for looking at the notes for this  vanilla, frangipani, milk and so on  and assuming that it's a purely feminine affair. But no, it's 100% unisex! Unusually, what pulls Remember Me firmly into the center is the frangipani; the variety used here smells more like peachy suede than tropical flowers. Remember Me is a milky chai suede that comfortably occupies the meeting place between gourmand, oriental, and leather. If you love unusual, complex sweet' fragrances such as El Born by Carner Barcelona and Leder 6 by J.F. Schwarzlose, then Remember Me might be your new obsession."," Bergamot, lemon, cardamom, tea, frangipani, ginger, milk, woody notes, cedar, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/61615.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Santal Nabataea Eau de Parfum,Mona di Orio," Inspired by the shifting red, pink, and cream layers of the sandstone at Petra, Jordan, Fredrik Dalman wanted to create a perfume that might bring the memory of the 4th century BC Nabataean Kingdom, for whom Petra was the capital city, back to life. A nomadic tribe by nature, Petra was a touchstone for the Nabataeans, and the main focal point of trade in the region. Santal Nabataea honors the inspiration of Petra in two ways: via references to the exotic fruit and spices traded in Petra at the time, and by using certain materials to emulate the dusty, rosy colors and textures of the sandstone of this haunting city. And wow, does it succeed. In exploring the dusty and sometimes astringent heart of true sandalwood, rather than its famously creamy facet, Santal Nabataea is that rare thing  a perfume that smells genuinely exotic in and of itself, rather than simply stuffed with as many exotic notes the perfumer can think of. A pared-back structure demonstrates confidence in its own ability to deliver its message without unnecessary embellishment. All the other notes here exist to showcase the sandal  the black pepper creating a spicy darkness at the back of your throat, the coffee deepening its masculine growl, and the black currant leaf and apricot notes giving off a tannic tea-like nuance that matches the wood in astringency. If it's the brusque, aromatic dryness of real sandalwood that you love, then make sampling Santal Nabataea a priority. Featuring sustainably-sourced santalum album from Australia as well as Indian sandalwood, it's the (rare) real deal."," black pepper, black currant leaf, apricot, nerium oleander, opoponax, Australian santalum album sandalwood, Indian sandalwood, coffee",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/51730.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, black pepper
Tokyo Eau de Parfum,Gallivant," It's 6 am in Tokyo as you make your way home through the quiet back streets, the air humid with early morning mist. As the electric cables above your head crackle and snap, a strange peace descends on the scene. Tokyo is finally at slumber, or at least in brief repose before gathering itself up again into the manic energy that courses through the city like a pulse. Gallivant's Tokyo captures the moment when Old Tokyo meets New, the sweet smokiness of Japanese incense of Kodo ceremonies spilling out of small wooden temples to meet the sweet-and-sour pungency of izakaya street food. There's a lot going on in Tokyo, the city, and so there's a lot going on in Tokyo, the scent. But despite the cacophony of notes, it all meshes into a singular statement on modern Japanese urban culture. The exciting buzz of yuzu and black pepper in the topnotes conjure the crackle of overhead electric cables swinging softly in the morning breeze, while wasabi, cardamom, and nutmeg lend a dash of complex sour-sweet flavoring to the brew. Tokyo smells intoxicating and strange; otherworldly in the way only exposure to a completely foreign culture can be. Japanese temple incense is the calm at the center of this storm, a cloud of gentle hinoki wood, smoke, and damp flower petals billowing out into the streets as we pass. Before the incense has a chance to turn to powder, a base of exuberantly-spiced ambers, patchouli, sandalwood, and musk moves in to drench the scent in the gold patina of orientalism. This might seem more Arabian-inspired than Japanese at first until you notice that the gentler Japanese accents persist, infiltrating the fog of resin with the aqueous, sweet-and-sour aroma of cardamom, the wasabi, and the silvery ephemerality of hinoki wood. Big city neon energy meets old world Tokyo: this scent brings us straight to the point where they intersect."," Yuzu, bergamot, black pepper, cardamom, wasabi accord, hinoki, cedarwood, nutmeg, iris, rose, incense, sandalwood, vetiver, patchouli, musk, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/766007.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, yuzu
34 Boulevard Saint Germain EDP Eau de Parfum,Diptyque," 34 Boulevard Saint Germain, the home of the original Diptyque boutique, is as close to a royal address as it gets in niche fragrance. Still alive almost 60 years after first opening its doors, ""The Maison"" is both an ever-evolving palace of luxury, and also a timeless shrine to its own origins, a magical space lined in rich waxed blond wood, vintage cabinets stuffed with fragrant curios, and the soft, warm comfort of sunlight streaming through the large, welcoming windows. The scent inside is an unknowable mix of every perfume sprayed, every candle displayed, and every raw material played with- a wholly unique form of olfactive serendipity. It's this complete aura, both the body and soul of the boutique, captured in 34 Saint Germain Boulevard Eau de Parfum. Perfectly balancing the warm, nostalgic tones of vanilla, sandalwood and tonka against a robust, multifaceted pink pepper, this EDP feels both modern and timeless, comforting and sensual, fresh and warm. Like the wondrous shop to which it owes its name, 34 Saint Germain Boulevard EDP is sure to cast a spell on all who discover it."," Pink pepper, sandalwood, vanilla, tonka",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/483250.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, pink pepper
Hemingway Eau de Parfum,Masque Milano," Masque Milano has gained a well-earned reputation as a launching pad for young talent- a brand that takes chances on up-and-coming noses and gives them the freedom to discover their creative voices. So when they met IFF trainee Fanny Bal, apprenticing under the legendary Dominique Ropion, and heard of her facility and ingenuity with vetiver, a seed was planted. And who better to dedicate a scent built around vetiver- rough and spicy, earthy and sweet, rich and complex- than Ernest Hemingway? With access to the full resources of the Laboratoire Monique Remy, Bal produces a sweepingly literary tribute to vetiver built from an exquisite vocabulary: woody, dry and spicy Haitian vetiver, with a slight bitterness, provides ideal contrast for the tart rhubarb of the opening. Javan vetiver is dirtier, with smoky tones and leathery facets to blend with the patchouli and leather base. And proprietary Vetiver Heart LMR, which takes hydro-distilled vetiver and puts it through additional fractional distillation to isolate the clean, dry heart of the grassy material without the earthiness, anchors the heart of the fragrance."," Ginger, rhubarb, vetiver heart LMR, Haitian vetiver, Java vetiver, cedar, patchouli, leather",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64009.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, ginger
Viking Eau de Parfum,Creed," This fall, The House of Creed introduces the masterfully crafted Viking, a fiery men's fragrance that bottles the fearless spirit of boundless exploration for the modern man who goes against the grain. Sixth Generation Master Perfumer Olivier Creed created Viking and was inspired by the incredibly crafted longships, a centrepiece of the Viking Age and one of the greatest design feats of the ninth century. A symbol of voyage and undeniable perseverance, longships were carefully designed for the skilled seaman who embodied unbridled determination to conquer. Viking marks the brand's first major men's scent since the introduction of the cult best-selling Aventus in 2010."," Bergamot, lemon, pink peppercorn, black pepper, rose, peppermint, sandalwood, vetiver, patchouli, lavandin absolute",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/49375.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Purple Flowers Eau de Parfum,Mancera," Housed in a stunning ""Ultra Violet""-tinted bottle (the Pantone Color of the Year 2018), Purple Flowers more than lives up to its bold presentation, delivering a rounded, vibrant, deeply woodsy floral scent that should entrance Mancera lovers and newcomers alike. Eye-popping bursts of citrus balance against a lush, rose-led floral bouquet made tantalizingly unisex by a rich, complex spice blend- pepper, ginger, and nutmeg. As it dries, the florals become sweetly ambered, weaving in woodsy and creamy tones warm enough to feel comfortable, yet still airy enough for a year-round sexiness anyone can rock in style. It's the perfect fragrance to complement the Color Of The Year: delightfully attention-grabbing at first, yet ultimately so wonderfully balanced that the hundredth time you experience it is every bit as satisfying as the first."," Mandarin, nutmeg, ginger, black pepper, elemi, fig tree, rose, patchouli, cedar, grey amber, white musk, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64935.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, mandarin
Ruh Eau de Parfum,Pekji," Ruh, meaning spirit in Sanskrit, is the collective scent of an air-conditioned souk in Turkey, where the delicious aromas of freshly-ground coffee, exotic spices, and incense mingle companionably with the scent of rose attars opened for passers-by. Ruh is exotic in an unfamiliar manner, rearranging traditionally-used notes like rose, coffee, and cardamom in a way that doesn't make you think of every other souk-themed oriental out there. And that's a rare feat. Ruh is rich, but not sweet or heavy. Roast coffee and crushed green cardamom pods pump a fragrant, aromatic freshness through the scent's cells, giving the Turkish rose a spiced wood character that men will love and find easy to wear. A blast of fiery saffron is a further nudge in the direction of masculine, wrapping the lush rose into folds of freshly-tanned leather. But the saffron is the real chameleon of Ruh; it softens in increments from inky iodine to the gently spiced milkiness of kulfi, turning the scent's dial from dry to lush. Breathe in Ruh, close your eyes, and you will feel the soul of the souk all around you, redolent with rich black coffee, piles of red saffron and green cardamom, Turkish leather jackets, and tiny bottles of rose attars opened, sniffed, and dabbed. Yep, Ruh has soul. Luca Turin thought so too, awarding Ruh a 4 star rating in The Perfume Guide (2018)."," rose, coffee, cardamom, saffron, jasmine, oud, musk, amber, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/806003.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, rose
Zeybek Extrait de Parfum,Pekji," Zeybek, which takes its name from an expressive Aegean dance for a solo male, is an animalic fougere that smells a bit like the minty chewing gum breath of a cowboy as he rakes out a horse stall. The way Zeybek teeters precariously between herbal freshness and smeary funk the whole way through is as electrifying as being plugged into a live socket. For us, Zeybek revolves around a handful of key aromatics that are so complex that they spin the scent off in several directions at once. Narcissus, yes, innocent little daffodil, exudes the fresh greenness of cut stalks, but also facets of soiled hay, civet, and jasmine, which creates a 3D picture of a horse stall. The central flowers in a barnyard' accord is freshened up top with salty herbs, lavender, and lemon, for an effect that smells like spearmint gum mixed with sea water. This thrillingly odd combination rests on an equally odd base of industrial notes such as rubber, gum, and putty, all shot through with cigarette ash. Engaging and completely different from anything we've ever smelled before, we'd call Zeybek an animalic fougere that's both resolutely modern and naturalistic in feel. The only cost of entry here is a sense of adventure and the refusal to be hemmed in by convention."," bergamot, hay, lavender, leather, lemon, musk, narcissus, tobacco, tonka, vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/806004.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Battaniye Extrait de Parfum,Pekji," Battaniye, meaning blanket in Turkish, is a technically what we might term a comfort scent. Well, you see amber and patchouli, and you draw your own conclusions. But to leave it at that does the scent's enormous complexity a great disservice. Because, although undeniably rich and comforting, Battaniye leans far more towards the dry warmth of textiles  wool, leather, silk  than it does dessert.   The perfumer intended for Battaniye to evoke the feeling of watching the rain from a balcony in Trabzon, a mountainous town on the Black Sea, and once an important gateway to Persia on the Spice Route. And it certainly captures the aromas of such a scenario  the scent of rain hitting soil, soot from chimneys, and the oily warmth of an old wool blanket pulled across one's legs to ward off the chill. But for us, Battaniye is all about leather. A spicy, molten core of leather roiling at the heart fuels the scent and gives it a resolutely masculine feel. It morphs slowly from a syrupy wetness that's almost animalic to the dusty warmth of old leather. Surprisingly, for a scent with so many oriental references, Battaniye comes off as distinctly Western, with a cowboy's dusty leather saddle firmly at the heart of things. Battaniye is comfort, yes, but it's the comfort of memory and atmosphere, not that of pudding."," amber, honeysuckle, java vetiver, labdanum, musk, patchouli, soil, soot, wool",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/806000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, amber
B-612 Extrait de Parfum,Nishane," In Antoine de Saint-Exupery's beloved children's book Le Petit Prince, the titular Prince is the only living being to come from a far-away asteroid known only as B-612. Traveling the universe, the Prince carries with him the spirit of imagination, open-mindedness and inquiry that he cultivated on B-612, and thus, the fragrance named for the asteroid is meant to convey that same spirit- as they put it, ""enlightenment through exploration."" So it should come as no surprise that B-612 is a dynamic, lively, and richly beautiful scent, combining classically aromatic and floral notes of geranium and lavender with a deeply woody heart and a warm, comforting base of oakmoss and tonka bean to create something compellingly timeless. While the result feels sophisticated and masculine, B-612 never loses sight of its joyfully childlike inspiration- this is a scent to wear on adventures, journeys, and new experiences with old friends. The Little Prince has taught generations of readers to hold fast to the wonder and goodwill that far too many lose when approaching adulthood- B-612 is an olfactive reminder that one need never let it go."," Lavender, geranium, cypress, cashmeran, cedar, sandalwood, patchouli, musk, oakmoss, tonka bean",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77421.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, lavender
Vain & Naive Extrait de Parfum,Nishane," ""It is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so important.""The character of the Rose in Le Petit Prince is an extremely important one- she is the Prince's true love, a beautiful, yet flawed companion whose vanity and naivete initially drives the Prince to leave his home asteroid, only for him to ultimately realize that for all her flaws, she is a unique being worthy of his love. With Vain & Naive, Nishane honors the Rose in all her wondrous complexity, delivering an airy, lovely fruity floral rose scent with unforgettable flair. Vain & Naive opens with an arrestingly bright burst of citrus, then quickly introducing the florals at its heart- a rose and jasmine combination both youthfully fresh and romantically lush. Mouthwatering notes of plum and raspberry keep things lively and light, while a gently ambered, woody base glows with soulful depth. The Little Prince ultimately opts to return to his asteroid, and his Flower- for all her vanity and naivete, his love for her is undeniably real and inherently worthwhile. One sniff of Vain & Naive, and you'll never want to leave in the first place."," Bergamot, orange, rose, jasmine, cedar, plum, raspberry, sandalwood, amber, patchouli, benzoin, tonka bean, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77422.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Komorebi Eau de Parfum,"Pierre Guillaume Paris, Parfumerie Generale"," Komorebi: a Japanese term that refers to the beauty of natural sunlight filtered through the forest canopy, and the glowing, deciduous effect it creates. It represents a connection between land and sky, with the tree acting as the perfect intermediary, connected closely to both air and earth, a conduit for light, energy, and life itself. Komorebi captures that connection in a gorgeously delicate aromatic floral, combining the bracing freshness of wild mint with a rich, gently sweet bouquet of reseda and mimosa and a blackcurrant note both juicy and aromatic. In the softly powerful base, hazelnut and smooth, lightly powdered tonka bean support a potent central note of oak wood. There are many forest-themed scents, each with their own balance between light and dark, earth, air, and vegetation- but as an impossibly luminous tribute to the forest at its lightest and brightest, Komorebi stands alone."," Mint, reseda, mimosa, blackcurrant, hazelnut, oak, tonka bean",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/34554.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, mint
Rose Magnetic Eau de Parfum,Essential Parfums," Rose Magnetic is a great example of what Essential Parfums sets out to do, which is to zone in on a great natural material and then hire great perfumers to create a simple but elegant structure where it can shine like a perfectly-polished stone. As addictive as its name suggests, Rose Magnetic takes us on a playful tour through all the fresh, sour, and fruity facets of the rose, before softening into the fluffy almond deliciousness of a Pierre Hermes Ispahan macaron.   In the opening, bitter grapefruit and leafy mint play up the spicy herbaciousness of rose, giving rise to the kind of sourness that makes your mouth water. In the heart, the solvent-distilled rose gives way to the lusher Turkish rose absolute, whose pert sweetness is fleshed out with an addictively juicy litchi note. Swirls of creamy musks, vanilla, and natural tonka bean fluff up the cushions in the base, an expanse of crÃ¨me patisserie that contrasts the berried tartness of the rose to perfection. A pleasure from top to toe, Rose Magnetic shows us what a perfumer can do with a few superb materials and the confidence to keep things simple."," Grapefruit, peppermint, Turkish rose absolute, rose extract, lychee, cedar, vanilla, tonka",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/803001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, grapefruit
Nice Bergamote Eau de Parfum,Essential Parfums," Nice Bergamote is indeed a nice bergamot! In fact, we think the name might be underselling it a tad. The juicy sourness of the finest 100% natural Calabrian bergamot extract bursts out of the bottle like a firework, drenching the senses in an icy freshness that feels like liquid sunshine. What's remarkable here is that all the other supporting notes match the bergamot in its naturalness, so they fade in and out of the picture depending on their volatility, as if designed by Mother Nature herself.  For example, the soft eddy of natural jasmine and rose petals that swirls up in the heart creates a velvety thickness that steps in when the tartness of the topnote begins to fade. A buttery ylang licks at the edges, adding a fleshy sensuality to the brighter notes, but none of the flower's usual loudness. It's worth noting that the bergamot never disappears completely, only softening from a verdant, limey sourness to a thread of mandarin-like juiciness that runs through the scent, connecting all the parts. The base plays host to a natural tonka bean extract from Venezuela that smells like a golden cream of hay, almonds, and espresso with a shot of milk. The tonka bean accent is subtle, not overly sweet, and is further reined in by a smoky, resinous cedarwood. If you're looking for a natural-smelling bergamot scent that doesn't devolve into the usual white musks or woody ambers, then Nice Bergamot is more than just nice - it's perfect."," bergamot, Jasmine Grandiflora extract, natural cedarwood extract, ylang ylang, tonka bean",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/803003.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
The Musc Eau de Parfum,Essential Parfums," Every line needs a musk, and this is The Musc, a name that signposts both the brand's sense of humor and the specialness of the scent. Calice Becker said she imagined this scentas a cloud of enveloping and comforting musk, and that's a great way to describe its effect. Wearing The Musc is like stepping out of the freezing cold into a home filled with warmth and love.   The Musk operates in the narrow margins between hot and cold  it is fresh and spicy enough to keep you awake, but at the same time, so creamily warm that you'll feel like a cat stretching languorously in front of an open fire. Applied to warm skin, the initial one-two punch of freshly-crushed lavender and red ginger feels spicy and herbal all at once. But copious amounts of Laotian beeswax and Australian santalum album soak the aromatics in a sweet, honeyed creaminess as warming as a lamb's wool throw. These notes  both fresh and warm  are finally swept up into a cloud of whipped musks that wrap the wearer in a velvety cloud of scent. Nirvanolide and Serenolide, both elegantly fruity musks produced by Givaudan, are true to their name here, creating a serene, nirvana-esque fluffiness that's as clean as kitten fur."," Ginger, beeswax, lavender, sandalwood, musks",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/803004.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, ginger
Mysterious Oud Extrait de Parfum,Bortnikoff," The signature scent of the Bortnikoff house, Mysterious Oud is more than just another westernized agarwood creation- it's a wholly original creation that combines exquisite oud from all over the world (including renowned ""10k by Feel Oud"") to delight the senses and cast a deep spell of power and wisdom. Mysterious Oud greets the wearer with captivating notes of ambery citruses and ripe fruits- Bergamot and Orange spiced up with cardamom and then soaked in amber, sweet, rich, and romantic. It's the perfect introduction for a heart dominated by- no mystery here- oud, specifically a blend of beautiful, authentic oud oils supported by light, gentle and well-balanced floral note that bring out the ouds' resinous, spicy, and sweet nuances. From Thai and Vietnamese to Indian ouds, more layers are added to increase the depth of the aroma, balsamic, woody and vanillic. Some of the best oud you've ever smelled, in the service of a scent that thrillingly defies boring, ordinary oud-scent construction? This is the kind of mystery we could use more of."," Bergamot, cardamom, amber, orange, tea rose, jasmine, cinnamon, clove, myrrh, castoreum, pink pepper, nutmeg, tonka bean, oud, sandalwood, tolu balsam, opoponax, cedar, lotus, labdanum, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/804000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Kazehikaru Eau de Parfum,Di Ser," Japan's northenmost territory, Hokkaido is a land of rugged natural beauty, four-season weather, and pioneer spirit, where the winds blow strong and free. It's the scents carried on that wind that inspire Kazehikaru, the native flowers and trees of Hokkaido's rocky coastlines and towering, forest-covered mountains, a collection of flora that teems with vibrant, wild beauty- a distinctly Japanese combination of refinement and energy. Tart, energizing yuzu blends seamlessly with smooth neroli, while an evocative mix of shiso leaf and lavender provide distinctive, herbaceous sensuality against a backdrop of uniquely sweet Japanese rose and woodsy, green vetiver. Beautiful and untamed, Kazehikaru glows with the spirit of Hokkaido."," Yuzu, neroli, lavender, shiso, Japanese rose, vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/78807.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, yuzu
Zest Marin Eau de Parfum,Fragrance du Bois," Anyone who's spend time wearing or smelling the unexpected summer hit Oud Vert Intense knows that Fragrance du Bois has a virtuosic adeptness with bright, fresh, complex fragrances. Well, Vert may need to slide over, as FdB's newest composition, Zest Marin, is every bit as lovely- the kind of eye-opening unisex that can and should be worn every single day between now and when the leaves change.   Like a day at the seaside, Zest Marin is crisp, effervescent, oceanic and fresh, with opening citrus tones of lemon and bergamot, perfectly complemented by the natural essence of galbanum. At the heart, lavandin and nutmeg bring out the best in each other in a partnership of delicious complexity, with vetiver, vanilla and woody musks providing irresistible base notes that simply make you want to plunge into the ocean of fragrance. If Fragrance du Bois gets any better at producing summer signatures, we may have to take a few months off."," Lemon, Bergamot, Galbanum.

Cap Neroli Eau de Toilette,PARFUMS DE NICOLAI," One of the most memorable aspects of the thoroughly gorgeous Cote d'Azur is the ubiquitous presence of orange trees, splashing the landscape with vivid color and perfuming the air with their beautiful scent. From a single tree, aromas of bright citrus, fresh woods, and smooth, creamy flowers float on the breeze, and when it comes to harvesting scented ingredients for perfumery, the versatility becomes astounding- one humble tree produces everything from bitter, spicy petitgrain to enchantingly smooth orange blossom absolute. Cap Neroli features every aspect of the Cote d'Azur's fabled orange trees, opening with a contrast of bitter petitgrain and sweet mandarin given a fresh aquatic shimmer via rosemary and mint. A heart of bright neroli and soft orange flower is enhanced with sweet ylang and fresh jasmine, all resting on a bed of fresh musks and oakmoss that linger for hours. It's a perfect tribute to a place of staggering beauty, and the ideal summer scent for just about anyone looking to bring a bit of the French Riviera with them wherever they go."," Petitgrain, orange, mandarin, rosemary, mint, neroli, ylang-ylang, jasmine, orange flower, oakmoss, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/313058.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, petitgrain
Fougere d'Argent Eau de Parfum,TOM FORD Private Blend," FougÃ¨re d'Argent is a bold reimagining of the classic fougÃ¨re, a structure that traditionally revolves around lavender, oakmoss, and coumarin. With oakmoss no longer available, Tom Ford has re-worked the model in a provocative manner, substituting moss with Akigalawood, a Givaudan captive derived from patchouli that has a wonderfully spicy, woodsy bitterness. What emerges from Ford's confident handling is a scent that smells truly masculine  earthy, herbaceous, and rich, with a radiantly spiced muskiness that billows around its wearer. If there's a scent that sums up everything that is great about old-school-meets-modern-cool masculine grooming, then it's probably FougÃ¨re d'Argent. The aromatic topnotes of lavender, ginger, and citrus notes give off a formal Savile Row vibe, with the sort of soapy, minty freshness one expects to emanate from a gentleman wearing an impeccably-tailored suit. Akigalawood stands in most competently for the traditional oakmoss, its spicy, mossy sharpness softened by the buttery labdanum amber tucked away into a corner. What marks out this fougere as a particularly modern twist on an old format is its use of coumarin. Whereas in traditional fougeres, the coumarin adds a dry hay-like grassiness, here the coumarin is taken in a sultrier, more oriental direction, emphasizing the musky sweetness of the tonka bean from whence the coumarin was extracted. Fans of aromatic lavender-tonka fragrances ranging from Gris Clair to Tom Ford's own Fucking Fabulous will likely love FougÃ¨re d'Argent for its bold updating of the fougere structure, but others appreciate it even more for its total lack of gourmandise. Dry, masculine, and admirably unsweet, FougÃ¨re d'Argent is for the man who effortlessly exudes confidence, no matter what he's wearing or doing."," mandarin, ginger, lavender, cistus, Akigalawood, coumarin Click Here For Ingredients ÃClose Fougere d'Argent by TOM FORD Private Blend Ingredients Please be aware that ingredient lists may change or vary from time to time.

Live In Colors Eau de Parfum,The House Of Oud," The perfect citrus is an elusive thing. Pretty much the Holy Grail of perfumery, in fact. Citrus notes are so volatile that the perfumer has to figure out how to keep them aloft and keep the scent smelling natural all the way through, a balancing act that's far harder than you might imagine. We're happy to report that Live in Colors pulls it off. It sparkles from top to bottom, without losing momentum along the way. In other words, this is the new summer freshie to beat.  The fizz of the opening is invigorating, with a burst of lemon and grapefruit so sharp you can taste it. It smells like an entire citrus tree pulped down and squeezed into the bottle, with everything from leaf to pulp and rind. The scent then deftly switches the charge to aromatics, running the juice over a bed of pink pepper and ginger root to keep those volatile citrus notes alive. There's a wonderful hot-cold effect going on in the background, the juicy sweetness of red fruit rubbing up against the coldness of spice. In the base, a soft, silvery hinoki wood supports the more aromatic notes but doesn't impose its own personality as insistently as cedar or gaiac. Live in Colors doesn't so much end as fade out gently, in a musky-woody trail that stays soft and clean. It's not a projection monster and it won't break any longevity records. But a citrus scent doesn't need to perform acrobatics to please us  it just needs to smell fresh and natural. And in that respect, Live in Colors scores a perfect 10."," Lemon, grapefruit, red fruits, ginger, pink pepper, musk, hinoki wood, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76421.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, lemon
Just Before Eau de Parfum,The House Of Oud," Just Before revolves around Palo Santo, the so-calledHoly Wood burned by the Incas and shamans to cleanse the spirit. The wood itself is sweetly fragrant with notes of pine, lemon, and mint, features the perfumers have cleverly chosen to accentuate with an equally bright trio of bergamot, lemon, and saffron, which melts effortlessly into the wood, leaving a film of orangey spice glittering on its pale, blond surface. It smells like citrus peel and cinnamon left to smolder on top of a freshly-lit piece of Palo Santo incense  smoky, but with a lively sparkle.  A rich, banana-ish ylang is a dollop of butter stirred into the cake, thickening the fragrance, and easing the woods and citruses into the spiced doughiness of benzoin. The contrast between the minty aromatics and the vanilla-sodden resins gives the scent an interesting bitter almond nuance that's not too far off the Hypnotic Poison model. But what really stands out here for us is the myrrh. Redolent of earth, wet stones, and anise, this ancient resin adds enormous depth, as well as a sepulchral darkness that contrasts the scent's more gourmandpatisserie elements. Delicious and almost edible in its spicy warmth, Just Before teeters precariously between incense, amber, and woods. But because it never tips over into any one category, it remains interesting. Sugar and spice and all things nice....Just Before is a seductive siren call, calling out to us like the proverbial gingerbread cottage in the forest."," Bergamot, lemon, saffron, palo santo, ylang-ylang, myrrh, vanilla, benzoin, amber, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76423.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Rehab Extrait de Parfum,Initio Parfums," What is the scent of compulsion? The fragrance that represents the deepest yearning, desire for which there is no solution but to give in? We'd find it hard to top Rehab, a sweet-yet-smoky stunner possessed of an almost primally compelling magnetism. The perfection lies in the sophisticated simplicity of the compostion- rich, sophisticated lavender and smoothly spiced tobacco set a vibrant yet refined tone, masculine-leaning but drop-dead sexy on just about anybody. As Rehab dries, smoky, creamy patchouli and vanilla create a warmly ambered aura that lingers for hours. We can't tell you how to use the dangerously seductive power at your fingertips- but you've been warned."," Bergamot, lavender, tobacco, cedar, patchouli, gaiac, sandalwood, vanilla, musks",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/802000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Psychedelic Love Eau de Parfum,Initio Parfums," Psychedelic Love is a highly addictive fragrance, with its creamy, powdery and floral facets, wavering between vanilla, almond and heliotrope, a combination that will drive you obsessively into addiction. This is sheer, giddy, indulgent delight, the florals melding sweet ylang, powdered heliotrope, and luscious Bulgarian rose with an impossibly smooth myrrh and creamy, mouthwatering vanilla. A base of robust yet smooth patchouli keeps things trippy- but something this sexy means you won't be traveling alone."," Bergamot, ylang-ylang, Bulgarian rose, heliotrope, myrrh, vanilla, sandalwood, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/802002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Side Effect Eau de Parfum,Initio Parfums," Thrilling, rich, and deeply sexy, Side Effect is a harmonious blend of tobacco, vanilla, rum and coffee that tantalizes the senses and awakens the spirit. Ignited with spices and anchored by a warm base with elements of leather and woods, it invites you in with vibrant energy, then soothes and seduces with smooth confidence. With an undeniable animal magnetism, Side Effect is guaranteed to garner attention- but maybe that was your intention all along?"," Tobacco, vanilla, rum, cinnamon",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/802004.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, tobacco
Nuda Veritas Eau de Parfum,Atelier des Ors," An indelible lightness of being lies at the heart of Nuda Veritas, the beginning of the spiritual quest of the search for happiness.The perfume unfolds with a delicate floral heart of jasmine and osmanthus encased in layers of textural whiteness, full of hope and yearning. Humanity is connected to the earth and minerals through hints of moss. We look to the sky and seek the naked truth, laid bare in a transparent haze with hints of patchouli and the gentle caress of Ambroxan."," Bergamot, orange blossom, jasmine sambac, jasmine absolute, osmanthus, patchouli, marigold, ambroxan, musk, moss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/74406.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Crepuscule des Ames Eau de Parfum,Atelier des Ors," Crepuscule refers to the moments of transition from light to darkness, and from dark to light. The sleepy, dusky hours and the brilliance of dawn and new beginnings. Crepuscule des Ames is the twilight of souls and a perfume to captivate the senses with fine spices and a warm golden glow. A second skin to wear in the dusky house while the souls are at play, when we feel deep desires and the duality inherent in our consciousness. A radiating warmth that speaks to carnal pleasure and desire. Incense, patchouli, and hyraceum heat the primative, animalic aura. A scent of moments when we seek the truth, to find a way through temptation."," Mandarin, cardamom, clary sage, hysope, incense, pimento berries, hyraceum, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/74407.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, mandarin
Gold Incense Eau de Parfum,Mancera," Some incense fragrances are quiet and spiritual, while others are sultry and seductive. But when was the last time you experienced an incense fragrance that was lush, floral and opulent? Introducing Gold Incense, a seductively exuberant, downright juicy floral incense that hums with light, life and happiness. By blending ripe, fruity mandarin with luscious rose, the rich vein of incense running through the center of Gold Incense is never dry or austere, but rather compellingly robust, playing off of spice-forward notes of coffee and pink pepper and smooth, rich patchouli and sandalwood to create an enveloping, three-dimensional composition. Maybe not everything that glitters is gold- but this stunningly robust, romantic take on incense could be nothing else."," Incense, pink pepper, mandarin, bergamot, coffee, violet, rose, jasmine, patchouli, sandalwood, benzoin, white musk, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64936.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, incense
Hindu Kush Eau de Parfum,Mancera," Rugged, imposing, and central to military history both ancient and modern, the Hindu Kush mountain range in Central Asia is a formidable sight indeed. It's a border not merely between Pakistan and Afghanistan, but between heaven and earth itself. To honor this wild location, Mancera presents a uniquely resinous scent, rich with spice and incense, perfect for the adventurous spirit in all of us. Hindu Kush opens with a sweet and complex layer of exotic spice, with prominent notes of saffron and clove reinforced with the energy of black pepper and the earthy resinousness of another famed export of the region- a cannabis essential oil harvested from authentic Afghan-grown plants. Oud, patchouli and woods dominate the heart, but their heaviest and darkest tones are played down, keeping the robust spiciness at the center of the composition. A vanilla and musk base works along the same concept, reinforcing the resins and spices without drowning them in overly rich or earthy tones and presenting Hindu Kush as that rarest of oriental fragrances- one with more subtlety than opulence. And as a result, it's hard to think of a human being alive that wouldn't smell unbelievable wearing it."," Saffron, cumin, cloves, black pepper, labdanum, davana, cannabis, agarwood, patchouli, sandalwood, cedarwood, amber, white musk, gaiac, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64933.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, saffron
Wild Python Eau de Parfum,Mancera," Sleek, seductive, and a little dangerous, Wild Python has all the primal instincts of its namesake. Its deadly secret? An exceptionally fine floral blend that melds deeply narcotic white florals with hints of fruit, patchouli and musk that lend a deceptively smooth contour to a fragrance that's still savagely sensual. With well above average projection and longevity, Wild Python will spend hours curling itself around you, its power on full display. How you choose to use it is up to you."," Tuberose, osmanthus, peach, bergamot, jasmine, orange blossom, patchouli, white musk, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64934.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, tuberose
Bois Dore Eau de Parfum,Van Cleef & Arpels," Fine fragrance has a stunning ability to represent myth and poetry in vivid reality- to make the conceptual come to olfactive life. In Bois Dore, Fabrice Pellegrin envisions a fantastical Golden Wood, glowing with rich woods, delectable spice and smooth tonka bean. While the core of the scent is undeniably the interplay between the velvety, robust wood notes and a powdered, vanilla-inflected tonka bean, the beauty of Bois Dore manifests itself in its remarkable versatility- fans of Tom Ford Tobacco Vanille and Penhaligon's Roaring Radcliff will find that a supporting note of tobacco imbues a familiar strain of regal, masculine texture, while the powderiness of the tonka and a distinctly sweet almond maintain a warm, feminine sensuality. And no matter your persuasions, a long-lasting tingle of black pepper and a salty mineralic note provide a unique and energizing sparkle. While not every fragrance lives up to its concept, we're thrilled to report that Bois Dore is every bit the luminous, fantastical Golden Wood we were promised."," Black pepper, mineral notes, cedar, vanilla, tobacco, almond, tonka, musk, teak",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/50210.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, black pepper
Pikovaya Dama Eau de Parfum,Xerjoff," A celebration of the Golden Era of Russian literature, Pikovaya Dama ""Queen of Spades"", named for the famed Pushkin story, is a glamorously vintage, unapologetically opulent emissary from bygone glory days. Blending sharp, vibrant citrus with a richly, unabashedly powdered romantic floral heart, atop a sensual base of musks, woods and vanillas. But in reality, describing the individual notes feels incomplete somehow, as the real achievement of Pikovaya Dama is a sumptuously blended, wholly pervasive atmosphere of vintage grandeur, where the pillow-soft powder, luscious florals and deep musky base all exist simultaneously, exuding a soulfully resonant aura that only strengthens as it wears. Extravagant, beautiful and unique- Pikovaya Dama is a rare treasure indeed."," Bergamot, lemon, rose, neroli, coriander, atlas cedar, orris, incense, nutmeg, patchouli, sandalwood, musk, bourbon vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/51148.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Amber Intense Eau de Parfum,Fragrance du Bois," The oriental, reinvented. When Fragrance du Bois set their sights on amber as a main component for their newest Prive release, our expectations- and imaginations- were sky high. After all, the Prive line is defined by exceedingly rare ingredients, including their proprietary 100% organic vintage oud, as well as a willingness to simultaneously embrace and defy convention, to deliver scents that knew when to follow traditional structure, and when to take bold risks. To that end, Amber Intense is certainly an amber scent- loaded with rich, resinous, balsamic fullness- but with its spicy, floral complexity, it's also so much more. Amber Intense opens with a spice and citrus laden burst, where notes of bergamot, tangerine, black pepper and cinnamon pop and fizz with vibrant energy. As the rich floral heart unfolds, an exquisite blend of rose, jasmine and neroli captives against the rich amber accord, a warmly resinous blend of styrax, labdanum and patchouli that doubles down with enduring base notes of benzoin and peru balsam alongside Fragrance du Bois' unparalleled vintage oud. The result is a scent that's rich but never heavy, complex but never confusing, with an undeniably confident elegance. Whether you approach Amber Intense from the perspective of an amber lover or that of a connoisseur of spicy orientals, you're sure to find your new signature scent."," Bergamot, tangerine, orange, black pepper, cinnamon, cumin, saffron, neroli, rose, jasmine, blackcurrant, patchouli, styrax, cistus, benzoin, peru balsam, musk, oud",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/75723.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Moth Extrait de Parfum,Zoologist," Their days are spent secluded in camouflage, the intricate pattern of their wings disguising them against a coarse backdrop of barks and rocks. When they finally stir, even their flight is concealed, shrouded beneath the cover of night. Moonlight ripples off a delicate coating of tiny hairs as their feathered antennae guide them in their search for a mate. Only one temptation can lure them from their quest. Should they succumb to the attraction of the flame, their urge to procreate may be quashed in a wisp of smoke and a smattering of ashes. At first encounter, the rich, gothic scent of Zoologist Moth may surprise but soon it hypnotizes. A heavy dose of dark spices jolts your senses before settling into a dusting of honey-sweet rose and dark, inky florals. Slowly, it tests its wings, taking flight on an exotic journey of nagarmotha, guaiac wood and patchouli. Beneath it all lingers a smoky undertone that serves as a constant reminder of the danger within the tantalizing flame."," Black pepper, cinnamon, clove, cumin, lemon, nutmeg, saffron, heliotrope, iris, jasmine, mimosa, muguet, rose, ambergris, honey, resins, gaiac, musk, nagarmotha, oud, patchouli, smoke, vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76018.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, black pepper
Unsettled Eau de Parfum,Bruno Fazzolari," Since when does the end of the world smell so pleasant? It's a fair question if your first exposure to Unsettled was the hand-blown flacon originally commissioned by the Nevada Museum of Art: an atomic blast shaped container that literally glowed green from the uranium glass used to craft it. So it's something of a surprise that the scent itself is downright happy- a fresh, creamy sandalwood brightened even more with mouthwatering pineapple and smooth black tea. The result is a wonderfully unisex sandalwood scent that feels like a day on the beach- smooth, easy to wear, and almost hypnotically relaxing. It's the kind of fragrance that would make an effortless signature- it's hard to imagine a circumstance or person it wouldn't smell amazing on. It's Bruno's clever way of juxtaposing the occasionally- but consequentially- overlapping histories of Nevada and the South Pacific. No, your bottle won't be made of uranium glass- we're pretty sure that wouldn't be a big hit with our shippers- but one spritz and you won't be worried about a thing."," Bergamot, china black tea, clary sage, pineapple, caledonian sandalwood, labdanum, vanilla, ocean breezes",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/69311.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Eau de Cologne,Les Bains Guerbois," A fiery, subversive, take-no-prisoners interpretation of the classic formula, Les Bains Guerbois EDC is no ordinary eau de cologne. Eschewing the familiarity of a citrus top, this EDC opens with a sensuously spicy mix of ginger and cardamom, igniting the senses before leading into a rich, woodsy heart of cedar and patchouli balanced against a smooth, mystical papyrus. The base is no less captivating, as sweet musk and warm amber intertwine with smoky, sacred frankincense for an eau de cologne of unparalleled depth and sophistication. Invigorating and seductive, this unique eau de cologne is the perfect scent for the boldly adventurous, the cheekily controversial, and anyone looking to break out from the monotony of the mainstream."," Ginger, cardamom, patchouli, cedar, papyrus, musk, amber, frankincense",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/797000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, ginger
1885 Bains Sulfureux Eau de Parfum,Les Bains Guerbois," While the legendary Bains Guerbois has undergone many transformations in its 133 years of life, it began as a temple of beauty and well-being, a renowned spa and bathhouse that played host to Belle Epoque luminaries from Renoir to Proust. 1885 Bains Sulfureux is an evocation of those early glory days, when an open door would release the aromas of thousands of essences of plants, herbs and flowers, carried on the warm steam of those legendary Turkish and Russian baths. After opening with invigorating top notes of juicy mandarin and bergamot, alongside herbaceous rosemary and blackcurrant leaf, a fresh floral heart of orange blossom and jasmine feels as soothingly lush as an infused soaking tub. And a complex, never heavy base of therapeutic essences including tonka, tolu, benzoin and incense enchant and delight, healing the spirit and empowering the body. Refreshing, romantic and complex, 1885 is a magical journey through time and space."," Bergamot, rosemary, blackcurrant, mandarin, orange blossom, jasmine, tolu balsam, benzoin, cashmere wood, incense, tonka, sandalwood, labdanum, patchouli, vanilla, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/797001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
1978 Les Bains Douches Eau de Parfum,Les Bains Guerbois," Paris, 1978- a legendary spa has evolved into one of the world's wildest nightclubs, and you have exclusive access. Your endless night begins in a joyful haze of noise, liquor and laughter- the signature bitter orange of a negroni for your date, and a whiskey infused with clary sage for you- boozy, bright and aromatic. A rush of gorgeous florals waft from the beautiful club-goers as you make your way through sensuous tendrils of tobacco smoke, towards the majestic cedarwood bar. On the dance floor, the exotic gyrations of thousands of beautiful people recall rich, seductive tones of myrrh, vanilla, and patchouli- the Bains Douches is but another waypoint in time and space connected to the revelries of bygone eras, and those yet to come. Rich, intoxicating and exciting, this is the smell of pure, hedonistic pleasure- and we can't get enough."," Yuzu, bitter orange, whiskey, davana, clary sage, rose, heliotrope, blond tobacco, myrrh, mate, amber, cedar, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/797002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, yuzu
2013 Residence d'Artistes Eau de Parfum,Les Bains Guerbois," For a brief moment before it was transformed into a boutique luxury hotel, the Les Bains space was given a unique form of rehabilitation- Paris' most accomplished and admired street artists were moved in to live there for several weeks, with the freedom to pursue whatever artistic goals they desired. This spiritual cleansing is commemorated with 2013 Residence d'Artistes, a beautifully fruity, woodsy, and floral scent that explodes with color and inspiration. Juicy peach and mandarin collide with lush violet and jasmine, mouthwatering cumin and cardamom, all against a backdrop of warm, musky leather. Like the short but amazing moment in the grand history of Les Bains that inspired it, this is an ode to creativity- the spontaneity, the serendipity, and ultimately, the memory that lingers in the aftermath."," Cardamom, mandarin, bergamot, peach, jasmine, papyrus, violet, cumin, musk, sandalwood, patchouli, leather",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/797003.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, cardamom
2015 Le Phenix Eau de Parfum,Les Bains Guerbois," ""In Paris, nothing disappears, and everything can come back to life.""It's with this sentiment that the legendary Les Bains once again steps out onto the scene. Having lived as a beloved spa and gathering house, then a world-famous party spot, then a luminary artists' retreat, its newest incarnation is a fusion of them all- a boutique hotel, a spa, a club, a waypoint. The full history of this magical locale is laid out in Le Phenix, with the rich scent of a majestic firebird rising from old ashes- fiery ginger and cardamom set the scene, while a smooth cedarwood heart projects strength, integrity, and tradition. Most of all, a bright, rich incense permeates throughout the fragrance, exuding ethereal beauty, timeless power, and warm spirituality. When you wear Le Phenix, you look forwards and backwards simultaneously, reverent towards the history of this grand place, but charging forwards in pursuit of new adventure and achievement. Le Phenix is a scent for those in perfect harmony with the eternal pleasures and rewards of the City of Light."," Ginger, cardamom, patchouli, cedar, papyrus, incense, musk, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/797004.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, ginger
Gelsomini di Capri Eau de Parfum,Carthusia," As is customary in the tradition of Carthusia  Gelsomini's beginnings originate from a legend which tells of Carthusians. Its origins come from kings and and queens, but above all, from flowers, the most beautiful in Capri.  Among these are delicate jasmine which, as if by magic, evoke the charm of a unique island in the bouquet of its new fragrance. Delicate sweet fruity notes are brought together in an intriguing fragrance which is fresh but persistent. Jasmine and Egyptian geranium combine with clove and ylang while the intoxicating cedar and zagara climax into the musky amber notes of bees wax and Madagascar Vanilla. One of a kind and only from Capri."," Jasmine, geranium, cloves,  ylang-ylang, orange blossom, cedar, beeswax, Turkish rose, Madagascar vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/52920.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, jasmine
Lavish Parfum,Boadicea the Victorious," A clean and fresh stunner with the typical sense of excitement and attitude that one has come to expect from Boadicea the Victorious. Uplifting and buoyant from the beginning. Bergamot dashed with lemon gives a sense of hope and expectation. The heart is bright and optimistic, orange flower meeting with decadent rose, peppered delightfully with nutmeg. The base is warm, yet soft, and full of rapturous joy."," Bergamot, lemon, orange flower, rose, pepper, nutmeg, sandalwood, cedar, patchouli, gaiac, vetiver, moss, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/48535.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Terra Mia Eau de Parfum,Carthusia," Carthusia has long held a well-earned reputation for their ability to capture the olfactory beauty of the Italian landscape- azure sea, juicy citrus, wild aromatic vegetation, and shining sun. But Terra Mia, a rare Carthusia gourmand, seems more inspired by the simple joys of traditional Italian life and culture- gatherings in the village square, puppet shows, fresh flowers in the market, and steaming cups of espresso. So while it opens with wonderful freshness- tart bergamot, bright pink pepper- the grand players here are warmer, deeper notes- mouthwatering hazelnut, sweet orange blossom, lush rose, and robust coffee, all set against a resinously ambered wood base both rich and soothing. As with all Carthusia scents, we feel transported, but this time we're in an ancient piazza full of life and laughter, an espresso in hand, joy in our hearts. We might not have grown up in Italy, but one sniff of Terra Mia and you'll agree- it feels like home."," Bergamot, neroli, pink pepper, rose, jasmine, coffee, hazelnut, orange blossom, vanilla, amber woods",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/52919.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Moscow Mule Eau de Parfum,Juliette Has a Gun," Crisp, potent and energizing- a Moscow Mule, that electric combination of premium vodka, fresh lime, and fiery ginger beer, served in an ice-cold copper mug, might just be the perfect summer refreshment. It's only appropriate that this simple, perfect formula is the inspiration for the latest from Romano Ricci and Juliette Has A Gun, a house that's always excelled at finding the complexity in minimalism. And what a knockout Moscow Mule is- blending bright, tart bergamot with a wonderfully spicy ginger note for an intoxicating kick from the very first sniff. In the background, a subtly powerful base of Norlimbanol- a Firmenich molecule known for dry woodsiness and a sexy hint of animalic amber- ensures rich longevity without sacrificing an ounce of freshness. Is Moscow Mule a simple scent? Absolutely. But in that simplicity is a stunning- and wonderfully easy to wear- cocktail perfect for literally any occasion. Sidle up to the bar and order yourself a Moscow Mule- who knows where your night will take you?"," Bergamot, ginger, woody notes (norlimbanol)",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/40131.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Fantastic Oud Eau de Parfum,Montale," What is the true identity of oud? While the ingredient can have many characteristics- sharp, rich, warm, medicinal, pungent, spicy- it's true nature transcends specific notes and becomes something more alluringly abstract- a sense of mystery, exoticism, romance and supernatural presence. This is at the core of Fantastic Oud, in many ways a culmination of Montale's illustrious work with the material, a sumptuous feast for the senses. This rich, nuanced and warm fragrance reveals notes of rose, patchouli, tobacco, incense and styrax that merge with the voluptuous notes of leather, sandalwood and ambergris revealing the rawest character of oud. In other words, it's every facet of oud, masterfully blended together to offer something for everyone in a hypnotically smooth, spicy, rich, warm, fresh, lush, seductive package. Whether you're a newcomer to Montale's ouds or you own them all, you're sure to fall in love with Fantastic Oud."," Incense, styrax, tobacco, oud, rose, patchouli, leather, sandalwood, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/354001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, incense
Chypre Mojo Eau de Parfum,Parle Moi de Parfum," In 1917, there was a new shape in the air when Coty launched its now legendary Chypre de Coty. Putting forth the idea that a perfume could smell as indefinably complex as the person who wore it, this landmark scent swept away the cobwebs of the simpler floral perfumery of the previous century. In the century that followed, the chypre idea proved to be an enduring one, its seemingly endless permutations of bergamot, labdanum, and oakmoss giving rise to some of the most meaningful perfumes in the world, like Mitsouko, Tabac Blond, and Pour Monsieur. Of course, time stops for no man (and no chypre). In this post-IFRA age, and 100 years on from the launch of Chypre de Coty, Parle-Moi de Parfum suggests that Chypre Mojo is what a chypre now looks like. Despite the absence of oakmoss, Chypre Mojo rolls in with all the presence of a properold skool perfume. Its combination of carnation and patchouli conjures up a phantasmagoric impression of a massive rose-patch chypre that's been soaked in plum wine and dusted with black pepper. A bright, pulpy heart of mango takes the stiff bones of the chypre and ages it backwards until it feels more legible for a younger audience. Chypre Mojo never feels less than a chypre, though. While the fruit keeps those feel-good endorphins flowing, the peppery carnation and patchouli duo adds that touch of vermouth dryness that says chypre as clear as a bell. Confident, modern, and ebullient, Chypre Mojo makes us think that, 100 years on, the chypre still has its mojo."," Bergamot, carnation, mango, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76710.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Heritage Eau de Parfum,Fragrance du Bois," Many fragrances offer you a journey to a faraway destination, but Heritage is a journey back in time, to an era when European high society was bold, beautiful and sumptuously opulent- and the fragrances were every bit up to that standard. Truly a haute couture scent, Heritage is an elegant, alluring potion that evokes grand ballrooms and ornate theaters- a true taste of the kind of luxury that too often has been sadly confined to a bygone age. Heritage opens with vintage panache, featuring fresh, invigorating notes of juicy bergamot and a bright twinkle of sparkling, ethereal aldehydes. A complex, yet approachable, heart of sweet jasmine and powdery orris is elevated with a touch of mystical frankincense, while in the rich, dignified base, a warm blend of woods, creamy vanilla, and superlative natural oud provide remarkable depth. Taken as a whole, this is the kind of opulence that prefers to pamper rather than overwhelm- it's genuinely comforting, conferring an almost hypnotic sense of well-being on the wearer. Sure, we'll never get to live in Paris as it was in the Belle Epoque, but with Heritage, we can visit- and what a glamorous visit it will be."," Bergamot, aldehydes, jasmine, orris, frankincense, cedar, sandalwood, vanilla, pure organic vintage oud",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/75722.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Patchouli Oud Eau de Parfum,Affinessence Paris," Tom Waits' voice was once memorably described by a music critic as sounding as if ""it was soaked in a vat of bourbon, left hanging in the smokehouse for a few months, and then taken outside and run over with a car""  and Patchouli Oud by perfumer Nicolas Bonneville has much the same quality. Earthy, tannic, and soaked in mysterious essences wrenched from trees in the depths of Indonesian and Javan jungles, Patchouli Oud is a study in brown. Many oud-based fragrances smell pungent and oily, but Patchouli Oud plumps for a dry, almost herbal take on its subject matter, for a result that runs surprisingly close to the clipped elegance of vintage powerhouse masculines. The oud, medicinal and slightly dirty, is first out of the gate, quickly followed by a dusty 100% cocoa patchouli that seems to invert all light, drawing us deeper into its shadows. As with any scent based entirely on heavy basenotes, there's always the danger of it turning into a lead balloon, but that's been avoided here thanks to use of a bright, grassy vetiver and the lemony smoke of elemi resin, both of which keep the composition aerated. The smoky chypric finish of whiskey-ish labdanum and bitter oakmoss confirms Patchouli Oud as the perfect choice for the gentleman daring enough to pull off an oud scent alongside a perfectly tailored three-piece suit."," Oud, patchouli, vetiver, cistus, elemi, incense, gaiac, tree moss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/796003.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, oud
Tempo Eau de Parfum,Diptyque," All too often,  patchouli scents seem to be apologizing for their star ingredient. ""It's patchouli, "" the refrain goes,  ""but it's not hippie patchouli."" Tempo,  the wonderful new patchouli scent from Diptyque,  defies such simple-minded rejection- after all,  it's explicitly inspired by 60's counterculture- but those fearing unbearably thick earthiness and lack of nuance will surely be delighted by Tempo's complex,  gorgeous subtlety,  which weds three distinct types of patchouli to a perfectly balanced mix of mate and violet,  delivering a scent both unapologetically patchouli-driven,  yet undeniably sophisticated.By building around a carefully calibrated mix of three sustainably-sourced,  ethically-harvested varieties of Indonesian patchouli,  Olivier Pescheux delivers a patchouli accord that celebrates all facets of the material: earthy,  woodsy,  spicy and sweet,  all balanced against one another with subtle elegance. This careful balance is further enhanced with lively,  green violet leaf and nutty,  spicy mate,  which serve to remove even the tiniest edges from the scent- the patchouli washes over you so gently that it's hard to even remember why it would ever be considered a divisive ingredient. Even if you long ago traded in your bell bottoms for designer jeans,  give Tempo a chance- you may never think of patchouli the same way again."," Bergamot, pink pepper, patchouli, mate, clary sage, violet leaf",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/483030.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Fleur de Peau Eau de Parfum,Diptyque," As part of Diptyque's 50th anniversary celebration, Fleur de Peau is meant to turn back the clock to the 1960's, and one of the counterculture's most beloved scents- musk. Warm, sweet, and deeply sensual, the musk oils of the 60's were more powerful than subtle, so how then to update that classic feeling for today's grown-up, yet nostalgic, audience? By wedding a gorgeous bouquet of various musks to a beautiful, iris-driven floral heart, Fleur de Peau has us in awe of its sophisticated, subtle, musky perfection.The musks at the core of Fleur de Peau are, simply put, heavenly- a divine combination of notes both cotton-soft and rich, light and soapy-given an extra element of sparkle with a perfect amount of aldehydes. A beautiful iris note- a bit powder, a bit paper, a touch of woodsy earth, but primarily clean- blends with fruity, gently ambery ambrette seed, and ambergris further extends a rich, mineralic tone that deepens the musks without displacing them. All together, it creates a skin scent with every bit as much complexity as a towering oriental, the kind of fragrance that will bring you back to your wrist countless times over the scent's impressive lifespan. It's a trip both forwards and backwards in time, a scent that celebrates the past with the sophistication of the future- and really, what could be more perfect for Diptyque's 50th anniversary? Musk lovers- your perfect skin scent has arrived."," Aldehydes, pink pepper, rose, iris, ambrette, ambergris, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/483031.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, aldehydes
Dead of Night Eau de Parfum,Strangelove NYC," Dead of Night is an oil-based fragrance featuring organic oud oil distilled from agarwood trees grown on a sustainably-managed 600-acre plantation in Borneo. It's the equivalent of the Slow Food movement, only in oud terms  no chemical inoculation, no rubbery oud aromachemicals, and little interference from humans. This slow way of farming agarwood produces oud oil that is authentically pungent at first, but quickly softens to reveal the supple, tangy aroma of lambskin freshly cured with hay, herbs, and tea. Polished and set in the frame of a fragrance composition like a jewel, a material like this oud shines. Just keep in mind that this is indeed real oud. Those with little to no experience of oud outside of commercial perfumery might be taken aback at how animalistic and raw the note appears at first, but fear not! In time, the fearsome braggadocio of the opening relaxes into a wonderful aroma of soft leather, delicately sour with accents of dried apricots and fermented tea. Violet leaf and bergamot add freshness to the composition, the crushed greenery and citrus notes mimicking the minty sparkle of agarwood grown on the island of Borneo. The florals are subtly placed so as not to distract from the golden, glowing oud, but a glimpse of rose and jasmine emerges in the heart to sweeten its hay-like tone. Subtle brushstrokes of sandalwood and incense help the oud to fade out gently at the end, but, like a theater star, it lingers for hours on stage, in full knowledge that it's what people really came to see."," Bergamot, violet leaf, jasmine, rose, amber, sandalwood, incense, oud",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/79302.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot

Melt my Heart Eau de Parfum,Strangelove NYC," A gourmand lover's dream, but really so much more than just a delicious smell, Melt My Heart is an oil-based fragrance that captures the dizzying sensation of falling in love. And if you imagine that to feel like falling slowly backwards into a featherbed filled with fluffy orris butter and dark chocolate, well, then your vision lines right up with that of Strangelove NYC. Creamy, soft, and utterly addictive, this scent combines the mouthfeel of powdered white chocolate and lipstick with the velvety bitterness of 85% cocoa.   Real orris butter, costlier than most other perfumery materials and described by Chandler Burr asliquid good taste, has been used generously here to give the more edible elements spaciousness and lift, like a puff of silvery breath on the cold air. It is thewhite element that contrasts so effectively with the dulcet bitterness of the dark chocolate note. Real oud, ginger, and mandarin are just present enough to draw out various facets of the chocolate and the iris  a spicy, woodsy undertone perhaps - but don't expect too dominant a presence. The sandalwood, in comparison, is a real MVP in this composition, its lush, buttered, coconutty sweetness playing off the dark chocolate and orris to create a delicious Mounds Bar accord that will make you want to nibble your arm. The perfumer, Christophe Laudamiel, says that Melt My Heart isfor falling in love. Well, we can't imagine anyone smelling this and not being helplessly in its thrall."," ginger, bergamot, nutmeg, sage, oud, dark chocolate, orris root",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/79306.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, ginger

Patchouli Argent Eau de Parfum,Fragrance du Bois," Compellingly soft, breathtakingly elegant, Patchouli Argent is a patchouli scent that demonstrates the subtlety and versatility of its oft-maligned namesake. By combining the brightness of citrus with lush, smooth florals, gentle incense and a touch of spice, Fragrance du Bois completely re-contextualizes patchouli's natural earthiness in an ethereal mist of romanticism. After the sunshine of a bright, citrussy bergamot opening, a lusciously floral heart of rose and jasmine floats onto center stage, given tantalizing exoticism with a dose of spicy coriander. The patchouli, spliced with soft, asian-inspired incense and gentle musk, wafts in slowly, increasing in intensity with such deliberate patience that there's never an even fleeting moment of harshness- instead, it feels like a guided meditation, a journey to a place both beautifully unknown, yet comfortingly familiar. Whether you're a patchouli lover looking for something unique, or an agnostic yet to discover what patchouli is truly capable of, Patchouli Argent is a unique delight that will linger in your memory."," Bergamot, rose, jasmine, coriander, musk, incense, woody notes, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/75721.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot

Impressions de Giverny Eau de Parfum,Fort & Manle," Impressions de Giverny is a scentscape inspired by Monet's famous gardens at Giverny. The artist, who was as passionate about gardening as he was about art, wanted to turn his garden into a livingen plein air version of his paintings, and so he did. The fragrance cleverly takes its cues from the two main areas of the Giverny garden: first, the famous Japanese water garden with its bridge and water lilies that feature in Monet's NymphÃ©as series, and second, the section where thousands of small flowers were planted to achieve the same blurred-at-the-edges, impressionistic effect espoused by his painting style. In other words, Impressions de Giverny takes its inspiration from two sources: Japanese botany and abstract floral perfumery. The way these two themes intersect is beautifully handled. The scent opens with a crisp, almost sour fruity tone, with zesty yuzu and red apple creating a delicate impression of native Japanese fruits and flora. But almost immediately you can sense the rugged, unpretentious greenery of shrubs and undergrowth shifting beneath, adding an earthy undertone. Threaded through these accords is an impressionistic swirl of flowers that's difficult to pick apart, but certainly combines the watery freshness of tulips and violet leaf with the denser, more honeyed aspects of magnolia, orange blossom, and osmanthus. There's a creamy warmth in the floral bouquet that feels great on the skin, underscored by subtle brushstrokes of mango, ylang, and peach. At the same time, it's also peppery and bright, thanks to flecks of lemony coriander and fig leaf that have been daubed on here and there for contrast. Finally, unlike many modern florals, there's a solid foundation here to keep it all afloat  a salty, musky ambergris and benzoin combo that not only shores up the florals but adds a touch of civety funk to the picture. We're just blown away by how perfectly the perfumer has combined all these minute brushstrokes of fruits, flowers, and greenery to come up with something that, despite being impressionistic and abstract in form, feels utterly coherent on the skin. If you loved Confessions of a Garden Gnome but fancy something less herbaceous and more fruity-floral, then make sampling Impressions de Giverny a priority."," Yuzu, bergamot, red apple, magnolia, rose, tuberose, osmanthus, orange blossom, fig leaf, coriander, tulip, neroli, mango, ylang, ambergris, benzoin, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/78118.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, yuzu
Oud Vert Intense Eau de Parfum,Fragrance du Bois," Who says oud scents can't be fresh?

Oud - Extrait de Parfum,Maison Francis Kurkdjian," From the Orient, oud conveys mystery and sensuality. From Laos, its land of origin, it draws purity and refinement. This extrait de parfum interpretation is built on a dream of ouda supremely elegant, precious and rare natural ingredient. It has wrapped itself in a musk and vanilla accord that releases a harmony of spicy rich aromas. An olfactory treasure born of sand, wind and gold. What We Think The extrait version proves that Mr. Kurkdjian knows how to take the wonderful EDP version of the Oud to a deeper, darker and more sensual territory. More intense resins are balanced with the savory saffron note and a feathery-soft vanilla accord that adds to the plushness. Not overly sweet or cloying, Oud Extrait continues to evolove over time with great sillage and longevity. A fantastic oud reference."," Saffron, Elemi from the Philippines, Ambrettolide, Cedar wood from Morocco, Sweet vanilla accord, Oud from Laos, Patchouli from Indonesia",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/49885.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, saffron

Parisian Oud Eau de Parfum,Fragrance du Bois," What does pure luxury smell like? Of course, that's a question with more than one answer, but now that we've got our hands on Parisian Oud, we'd find it hard to imagine that anything could feel so sumptuous, so lush, so downright sophisticated as this wondrous combination of spice, florals, and a proprietary, organic oud extract so deep and rich that it makes our toes curl.With an opening gambit of cheerful spice provided by pink pepper and cardamom, Parisian Oud develops smartly with a top note of grapefruit, quietly tempered with subtle almond. The body opens into a medley of florals, rose essence, white jasmine, and geranium, before leather and Fragrance du Bois' 100% pure, natural oud builds the scent into a complex, sophisticated symphony. Cistus labdanum and frankincense then add rich, resinous notes to a base that evokes an almost ethereal smokiness, with sandalwood and patchouli easing the ensemble into a soft leather chair of a scent."," Pink pepper, cardamom, grapefruit, almond, rose essence, geranium, white jasmin, pure organic vintage oud, leather, frankincense, moss, labdanum, sandalwood, patchouli, musk, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/75711.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, pink pepper
Fabulous Eau de Parfum,TOM FORD Private Blend," Vulgar, shocking, rude, funny, tongue in cheek....no matter what you think of the name, there's no denying that it's got people talking. But in the kerfuffle over the name, has the fragrance itself been a bit overlooked? We think it might have been. The truth is that Fucking Fabulous is very good. It's an edible but fresh suede scent that borrows a bunch of bitter herbs from old school fougeres, scads of buttery tonka from the gourmand category, and wraps it all up in a musky cashmeran glow. And guess what? Totally works.  Clary sage and lavender top out the scent, their clean, smoky greenness meshing seamlessly with plush orris butter to form a leather note that's both soft and aromatic. Lashings of bittersweet almond and tonka bean beneath give the scent a velvety, almost oily-resinous sweetness, like white chocolate melted down with coffee grounds. The fragrance moves between bitter and sweet, herbal and creamy, powdery and oily over the course of the wear, keeping the journey totally interesting for us. Rumor has it that Tom Ford took one whiff of this creation and exclaimed,This is fucking fabulous! We're inclined to agree. Set your feelings aside for the name, take it out for a ride, and you may agree as well."," Lavender, clary sage, bitter almond, tonka bean, orris root, leather, cashmeran, amber, white woods Click Here For Ingredients ÃClose Fabulous by TOM FORD Private Blend Ingredients Please be aware that ingredient lists may change or vary from time to time.

Black Gold Eau de Parfum,Mancera," Bold, fresh, luxurious and sensual, Black Gold is a versatile masculine leather fragrance for today's renaissance man, the rare example of a scent equally comfortable on the beach, at the bar, or in the boardroom. Jump-started with an electric crackle of citrus and spice set against a smooth, compelling lavender, Black Gold soon develops a rich floral heart, kept masculine with the refreshing saltiness of oceanic notes and a perfectly balanced patchouli. And as it dries further, the leather- not too smoky, nor too soft, but with a quiet, confident ruggedness- takes control, lingering for untold hours at just the right volume to carry you from morning to evening, no matter the setting. A signature scent must balance versatility, sophistication, and that so-hard-to-define Wow Factor that can turn heads and make a special someone weak in the knees.

Vanille Fatale Eau de Parfum,TOM FORD Private Blend," Tom Ford doesn't always do vanilla, but when he does, the results are never anything short of spectacular. Enter Vanille Fatale, a purring, prowling, seductively fanged new vanilla scent whose initial subtleties belie the dangerously glamorous depth within. Opening with a quiet but fiery growl of saffron and coriander, Vanille Fatale's mystery soon deepens as a smoky blend of myrrh and olibanum incense begin to cloud the room, draping themselves around a sweet floral bouquet and an increasingly creamy, sensuously full vanilla. As coffee and roasted barley bring a comforting, yet subtly edgy dose of warm and resinous character, a rich mahogany wood keeps everything in balance, providing enough robust unisex woodsiness to make this scent an easy recommendation for men and women alike. And for those of us who prefer a finely-sharpened blade to blunt force, Vanille Fatale is a sotto voce stunner, ideal for drawing the object of your seduction ever closer without shouting over the room.

"Feb. 14, 1912 Eau de Parfum",Rundholz Parfums," Warm and cool, sharp and milky, rooty and bright, Feb.14, 1912 is a study in rich contrasts. Opening with a rich, bittersweet burst of citrus cut with deep aromatic notes of star anise, fennel, and licorice, the scent soon reveals a deep, rich iris note, waxy, rooty and so smoothly earthy as to almost be papyrus-like. A distinctive milk note softens the dryness of the florals, adding comfort and contrast. And in place of the incense that makes up the backbone of most Rundholz fragrances, here a distinguished, balsamic leather note plays that part, bridging the gap between the spicy, the creamy, the musky and the floral. Refined and understated, yet complex and deeply resonant, Feb.14, 1912 is unmistakably a Rundholz creation- and also unlike anything they've offered before."," Orange, bergamot, star anise, fennel, licorice, milk, iris, rose, jasmine, ylang ylang, heliotrope, carnation, carrot seed, cedar, white musk, leather, tonka",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/67802.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, orange
Sasora Parfum,Di Ser," Sasora, like all other fragrances in the Di Ser range, is 100% all natural, and features the finest absolutes and essences available in the world. Sasora is named for one of the 6 fragrant types of aloeswood (agarwood) traditionally used in the Kodo ceremony, the art oflistening to Japanese incense: sasora, kyara, manaban, rakoku, sumontara, and managa. Cool and sour, sasora is thought to be equivalent to the first and finest batches of wild Hindi oud brought out of the jungles of Assam, in Northern India, and distilled exclusively for the use by the royal families of the Arabian Peninsula. The sasora oud oil used in this fragrance is 100% pure and of the highest quality available. Its scent profile boasts a monastic purity that reminds some of kyara, especially in the first few moments when it is heated over ash and mica plates as incense. However, the main characteristic of sasora is a herbal sourness, and it is this quality that has been accentuated in Sasora, the perfume.The citrusy brightness of yuzu is first to buzz the palate, cleansing the mind of all clutter and preparing the way for a Zen-like state of bliss. The citrus is followed by the biting greenness of camphor and the medicinal, lavender-like properties of spikenard, a herb grown high in the Himalayas. Both camphor and spikenard are beloved notes in Japanese culture, representing the herbaceous bitterness of snow-covered herbs and moss in a Japanese forest. Considered spiritually cleansing as well as elevating, these materials are typically used to flank aloeswood in traditional Japanese incense sticks. And indeed, Sasora does smell like the finest aloeswood incense from Shoyeido and Baieido  herbal, bittersweet, spicy, and medicinal at first, with a silky finish of sweet, powdered woods. The rosewood truly shines here, framing the precious oud oil and spikenard against a spicy, aromatic backdrop of rosin and the interior of a hand-carved musical instrument. Real oud oil from noble Assamese stock, stripped of its leathery animalism and polished to a high shine with herbs, aromatics, and yuzu  this might be the first oud fragrance we're tempted to wear in hot weather or even to the office."," Yuzu, agarwood, camphor, jatamansi (spikenard), palisander rosewood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/78800.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, yuzu
Akanesasu Eau de Parfum,Di Ser," Akane sasu sora,  a wonderfully evocative phrase used in traditional Japanese poetry to express the vivid red glow of a particularly beautiful sunset. It's a phrase imbued with splendor,  suggesting that there are unique moments where the natural world drifts especially close to the supernatural realm,  with awe-inspiring results. To be certain,  a fragrance that draws on this lovely imagery must contain the same power,  the same energy,  the same reverence. Luckily,  this eye-openingly bright,  joyous and rich ode to citrus,  jasmine and vetiver is every bit as compelling as its namesake. As if to mirror the color progression of a sunset,  Akanesasu opens with a vivid burst of orange and bergamot,  where intense green coexists with the warm orange of juicy citrus fruit,  mouthwatering and energizing. A rich,  fresh jasmine heart (nothing heady or indolic here) positively glows with quiet majesty,  and an emergent vetiver base eschews the spikier side of the note in favor of gently woodsy warmth,  leaving you with the contented relaxation one feels as the sun dips behind the mountains,  leaving the sky painted red. A fragrance for summer sunsets and moments of appreciation,  Akanesasu is poetry in a bottle."," Orange, Bergamot, Jasmine sambac, Vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/78805.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, orange
Amber Absolutely Eau de Parfum,Fort & Manle," Amber fragrances are often associated with warmth, comfort, and beauty- but can an amber be dangerous? In the hands of Rasei Fort- absolutely. Here, the dynamic new nose behind Fort & Manle envisions amber as a trap, a seduction, glowing so brightly that those drawn to its light cannot realize they've become the prey... until it's too late. Don't get us wrong- this is one of the most delicious, warm and downright rapturous ambers we've experienced- rich, resinous labdanum, spiked with benzoin, sweetened with a golden honey and juicy plum. But an unexpectedly striking note of rose manages to feel both lush and thorny, and raw, spicy vetiver splices with stout cedarwood to deliver a powerful bite when least expected. Amber lovers, you'll fall head over heels for this rich, creative and ferocious elixir. And those who normally shy away from dessert-sweet amber scents- maybe it's time to try an amber with some fangs."," Musk, amber, benzoin, labdanum, honey, plum, rose, vetiver, cedar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/78100.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, musk
Fatih Sultan Mehmed Eau de Parfum,Fort & Manle," A tribute to the opulence and glory of the Ottoman Sultanic Empire, Fatih Sultan Mehmed is a grand fragrance indeed, well worthy of the outsized reputation of Mehmed the Conqueror. Crisp, juicy apple bursts off the skin from the very first spritz, while a heart of romantically smooth flowers- lush Damask rose and vibrant iris- balances expertly against gorgeously textured, gently spicy ambergris, keeping the floral heart both lively and unisex. Finally, a sumptuous drydown of woods, musks and resins further accentuates the lavish character of the scent, allowing the complexity of the ingredients to remain front and center while never feeling as heavy or spice-laden as your typical exotic oriental. Ambergris lovers, we recommend getting your hands on this scent today- put simply, Fatih Sultan Mehmed smells like a million bucks."," Bergamot, apple, petitgrain, rose, tulip, iris, vanilla bean, benzoin, amber, ambergris, cedar, patchouli, oud",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/78103.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Harem Rose Eau de Parfum,Fort & Manle," A soliflore is a big test for a young perfume house- when the adornments of complicated genres and endless ingredient lists are stripped away, when the goal is to deliver one simple, beautiful floral, how will it deliver? With Harem Rose, a gorgeous rose soliflore with gently oriental elements, we have our answer. Yes, it's a rose scent, but not all roses are created equal, and the Damascene Rose that Rasei Fort presents here is ethereal, a lush but youthful pink rose floating on a wave of soothing musk, gentle vanilla and the slightest hint of earth and spice from a subdued vetiver. The result is substance without heaviness, a truly three dimensional rose without a single thorn, a fresh floral that sinks happily into cloudlike repose. If you love fresher, gentler roses but don't want to smell like a teenager, great news: Harem Rose beckons."," Amber, benzoin, vanilla, rose, cashmere woods, vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/78104.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, amber
Bojnokopff Eau de Parfum,Fort & Manle," An extravagant homage to the showmanship of pre-revolution Russia's master illusionists, Bojnokopff (formerly titled Mr. Bojnokopff's Purple Hat) is itself a throwback- a sweet, smoky, darkly woodsy gourmand that defies characterization even as it enchants all who encounter it. Our grand illusion opens with a deep, dark oud note, pungent enough to avoid the dreaded ""medicinal"" tag but pleasantly balanced with wispy wood smoke and a complementary vein of smooth, clean French lavender. As the act progresses, the smoke pouring from our titular hat begins to thicken and billow, taking on the warm creaminess of vanilla and the indulgent richness of Belgian chocolate, simultaneously mouthwatering and, in harmony with the ever-present oud, seductively mysterious. As the smoke fills the stage, deep, spicy woodsiness prevails, with gaiac and cedar combining with an almost oily vetiver to delightful effect- when the smoke finally clears, only the hat itself remains on stage. Who is the mysterious Mr. Bojnokopff, and how can his magical fragrance be both deliciously gourmand and seductively woodsy all at once? Would you really want to spoil the illusion by finding out?"," Oud, lavender, vanilla, chocolate, vetiver, gaiac, cedar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/78106.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, oud
Slowdive Eau de Parfum,Hiram Green Perfumes," Is the name of Hiram Green's latest all-natural stunner a reference to Slowdive, the seminal UK shoegaze band who recently made a triumphant return to recording after a two-decade absence? The perfumer's notes are vague, referencing only ""the mood of those languid afternoons when the sweetness of the Indian summer air is almost palpable."" But it's not like those two concepts are unrelated- after all, the best shoegaze music is a lot like that feeling Green describes- an intense, steady hum of warmth and light, almost embryonic in its soothing envelopment. This is the feeling of Slowdive, a richly honeyed bouquet of potent white florals, hazily syrupy and mouthwateringly sweet, with a spicy-floral tobacco blossom featured at the center. The result is a gloriously but carefully balanced overdrive of olfactive noise, a fuzz of ambered, resinous fruits, lush, narcotic florals and invigorating spice, and the newest example of Hiram Green's remarkable ability to make disarmingly complex natural fragrances without limitation. While the connection between fragrance and band remains (appropriately) blurry, we can't help but feel that they'd approve."," Neroli, orange flower, tobacco blossom, tuberose, honey, dried fruit, resin",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/68105.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, neroli
Day Dreams Eau de Parfum,Montale," Like the warm summer nights in Greece, where the daylight is endless and the air is ripe with flowers. Montale's whisper-soft Day Dreams is about what is left when all cares melt away. A juicy burst of mandarin opens up a romantic whirlwind of white flowers - neroli, jasmine, orange blossom - and a tropical hit of tiare. As it all floats along a fluffy cloud of vanilla and coconut, the sensual, musky fragrance proves its worth as truly a dream come true."," Orange blossom, jasmine, mandarin, neroli, tiare, sandalwood, vanilla, coconut",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/35483.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, orange blossom
Arabians,Montale," Arabians is about capturing that feeling of royal adventure, with wind in your hair and a lover by your side. Inspired by the King of the Desert, the Arabian Horse, this regal fragrance takes the classic fougÃ¨re and takes it for a musky, sensually spiced spin. Sweet clean lavender heads the way, accompanied by a sexy blend of cardamom, rose, warm patchouli, and the most subtle use of oud by Montale we've seen yet. The result is stunningly seductive - an elegant leathery fougÃ¨re that dares you to lean in and come along for a mysterious ride."," Lavender, leather, red thyme, cardamom, patchouli, Malaysian aoud, vetiver, rose, amber, animal musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/35482.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, lavender
Ummagumma Eau de Parfum,Bruno Fazzolari," As a multi-sensory artist, Bruno Fazzolari's creations pulse with the energy of magical realms, from the blazing glow of Feu Secret to the crackling fluorescents of Room 237. But with Ummagumma, Fazzolari ushers us into his darkest, sultriest locale yet- a languorous world of rich gourmand notes that flow with indulgently deliberate sweetness- aromatic, smooth tobacco, resinous labdanum, creamy vanilla and sandalwood- and foremost of all, a mouthwateringly warm, rich chocolate note, sweet and robust without a drop of fake sugar. This is an adult gourmand, a scent to be savored, evocatively sexy on men or women, young or old. Perhaps it's not right to call it a gourmand at all- it's a portal to yet another world that defies too-simple categorization while at the same time feeling immeasurably appropriate for the one category it firmly falls into- that of an original Bruno Fazzolari creation. Chocolate lovers, winter adventurers, and all who appreciate original art- don't miss Ummagumma."," Saffron, carnation, chocolate, tobacco, leather, labdanum, sandalwood, cedar, frankincense, tonka bean, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/69309.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, saffron
Black Vanilla Eau de Parfum,Mancera," Black Vanilla by Mancera is a milky floral vanilla that soothes rather than challenges, which is exactly what we all need every now and then. Soft hints of blackcurrants, coconut, and peach cast a gauzy veil of fruit over the vanilla accord, itself sheer and barely sweet, like coconut milk put through a milk frother. The juicy berries and peach lend a discreetly flirtatious vibe, but in general, the lack of syrupy sweetness marks this out as a refined, grown-up vanilla scent.  In time, a powdery rose emerges from the peachy, berried vanilla froth, creamy puffs of jasmine petals and candied violet trailing soon after. The florals, diffused in an enormous cloud of soapy white musk, feel more like a swirl of expensive cosmetic powder than freshly-cut flowers, giving the scent a distinctly clean, feminine vibe. In terms of sillage and longevity, Black Vanilla lasts the day, but is soft rather than loud. Despite the name, therefore, Black Vanilla is truly a perfect fragrance for days when you need your scent to stay low-key but still smell amazing. Gently feminine, its cluster of powdery flowers, musk, and lightly frothed vanilla-coconut milk feels more like a perfect veil of milky, floral lotion rather than a full-on perfume."," Bergamot, blackcurrant, coconut, white peach, rose, violet, jasmine, vanilla, white musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64930.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Red Tobacco Eau de Parfum,Mancera," Red Tobacco by Mancera is an incredibly potent, sexy tobacco fragrance with enough spice to turn the heat up on a cold winter's night. The opening is deceptively sharp and fresh, a one-two punch of leathery saffron and crisp apple, bathed in a haze of that smoky, medicinal Mancera oud. This phase smells like oud chips fermenting in a vat of honey  medicinal, slightly pungent, and deliciously sweet-n-sour. But it's not long before the scent shakes off any semblance of freshness and melts into a thick, juicy amber that smells like a river of molten honeycomb coursing around pipe tobacco, dried plums, and fruitcake. Red Tobacco is so confidently spiced with nutmeg and cinnamon, it practically sizzles. With time, the sweet, rich pipe tobacco emerges from its bed of amber and spice to reveal itself as the true star. The bombastic sweetness of the scent is toned down a little by the slightly dirty, smoky oud note and a patchouli note that smells like damp dark chocolate. A naughty little cousin to Montale's Honey Aoud, Red Tobacco will warm your bones in winter and the blood of anyone who picks up your scent."," Saffron, cinnamon, incense, nutmeg, white pear, green apple, oud, patchouli, jasmine, tobacco, amber, guaiac wood, sandalwood, Haitian vetiver, Madagascar vanilla, white musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64931.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, saffron
Copala Eau de Parfum,Xinu," Copala focuses on copal resin, used as incense by the indigenous peoples of Mexico and Central America since the time of the Mayan civilization. Black copal is heavy and rich, known for its bittersweet bay leaf scent; golden copal is as smooth and sweet as honey. Here, it is the good-natured sweetness of Mexican golden copal that gives this dry, incensey vanilla its edge. The faintly cinnamon-and-bay-leaf spiciness inherent in the resin is firmly underlined by a piquant pink pepper note that runs all the way down the spine of the scent to the base. Smoky mesquite woods keep the sultry Mexican vanilla powdery and elegant - no gluttony or sugared excess here. Instead, a dark cocoa-ish tone develops, giving the woody vanilla a dustiness reminiscent of the white ash left after the copal burns clean away. What's most impressive about Copala is its lightness and naturalness: compared to most other spicy vanilla orientals, the XinÃº rendition is positively monastic."," Pink pepper, copal, mesquite, Mexican vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/78602.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, pink pepper
French Affair Eau de Parfum,Ex Nihilo," French Affair pays tribute to the fiercely elegant chypres of Paris in the 1970's  earthy, mossy affairs worn by the free-thinkers of the world who strolled through the Left Bank like they owned it. And they did. Women in Le Smoking tuxedos unbuttoned to the navel, men in full-on Oscar Wilde mode: nonconformists who smelled of Gauloises smoke, crushed velvet, and Aramis 900. But French Affair is no nu-chypre pretender. It is authentically, damply, unmistakably oakmoss-y, with that familiar inky feel that gives chypres their backbone. A rich wave of Indonesian patchouli - earthy and camphoraceous - jumps out at you from the topnotes, riding hand in hand with the moss to create an accord of coppery, freshly-turned soil. The lychee note smells more like overripe plum, momentarily sweetening the earthier notes. Violet leaf streaks across the loamy gloom, as surprising as a camera flash. But the dark, musty earth notes are what prevail  a bolt of black velvet unfolded after many years in storage. Eventually, this accord reveals a spiced, plummy rose and a pungent cedary drydown that is both aromatic and slightly sweaty. French Affair stands shoulder to shoulder with the great patchouli chypres of the 1970's, Aramis 900, Aromatics Elixir, and Givenchy Gentleman. Close your eyes and breathe in the smell of cigarette smoke floating through velvet collars soaked in patchouli. Dark, moody, and viciously sexy, French Affair is indeed a very French Affair."," bergamot, lychee, violet leaf, rose, Atlas cedar, angelica, pepper, Indonesian patchouli, vetiver, oakmoss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/72020.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Note de Yuzu Eau de Parfum,HEELEY," In Japan, when the yuzu citrus ripens in winter, traditional baths are taken with the whole yuzu fruits floating in the water, imparting their delightful scent and invigorating the senses. Note de Yuzu, Heeley's collaboration with the Tokyo-Parisian fashion house and music label Maison KitsunÃ© takes the yuzu bath as the perfect point of departure to encapsulate British, French, and Japanese influences into a sparkling, soothing, sensual fragrance.  Note de Yuzu opens as exuberantly as a bottle of champagne, the celebratory pop filling the air with effervescent droplets. The energy and zest of Japanese yuzu are drenched in hydration with tart lemon and fruity mandarine. As the immediate fruity freshness softens, the gentle marine notes unfold like saltwater on skin, reminiscent of Heeley's iconic Sel Marin, but with a clean, sensual white musk base. Note de Yuzu is a charming tonic for the senses, imparting that cool-kid vibe of relaxed chic done right."," Yuzu, lemon, mandarine, sea salt, vetiver, white musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/31526.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, yuzu
Birch Eau de Parfum,Andrea Maack Parfums," To work on Birch, Andrea Maack relocated to her family cabin hidden away in the Icelandic highlands. Her childhood summers were spent in this wooden cabin, surrounded by the scent of birch trees. An atmospheric fragrance above all, Birch transports the wearer to the solace of the Arctic tundra, a million miles away. An airy bergamot creates a cool breeze with lightly spicy ginger and pink pepper, sensually drifting along. The character of the scent lies in the meeting of dark guaiacwood and cypriol, however, that capture the arctic woodland, with rising columns of bonfire smoke. Birch is gorgeously evocative, alternating between the fresh cold air and smoky, earthy woods. It's one of those scents that you wear for yourself, to breathe in deep and enter another world."," Bergamot, pink pepper, ginger, guaiac wood, cypriol, patchouli, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/52811.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Beach Hut Man Eau de Parfum,Amouage," When is a beach scent more than just a beach scent? When it's part of Amouage's stunningly inventive suite of new releases. Beach Hut Man, the newest from the Midnight Flower collection, is no mere salty aquatic- instead, as told by Creative Director Christopher Chong, it's ""the story of an iridescent aromatic idyll that unfolds in the fragrant wild garden of a beach hut."" What does that mean in plain language? It means that Beach Hut Man is equal parts oceanic and intensely green, for an utterly unique and exciting new masculine that invigorates and relaxes in equal measure.With a bracing opening of mouthwatering mint, smooth orange blossom and bitter galbanum, Beach Hut explodes with complexity from the very first spritz. Salty, spicy vetiver evokes the ocean and the garden in equal measure, while wild green moss and ivy and earthy patchouli add to the naturalistic, yet relaxed, vibe. As it dries, a rich and masculine base of dry woods lingers for hours. Born in an oceanside paradise but sophisticated and sexy enough for a palace, Beach Hut Man is a creative and compelling new masculine that we think is destined end up alongside Amouage's very best."," Mint, orange blossom, galbanum, vetiver, moss, ivy, patchouli, myrrh, dry woods",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/41888.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, mint
Bruma Eau de Parfum,Cire Trudon," Bruma meanssolstice in Latin, which brings to mind something one might wear to a pagan ritual or to howl at the moon. But the word Bruma' is also close to the French word brume for mist, and we think that this word fits the scent better. It begins with a gentle misting of iris, violets, and peony, all swirled together into a creamy, fluffy cosmetics accord that's part lokhoum, part lipstick. A rooty iris stands at the center, quietly gathering itself up into a soft leather, aided by black pepper, which accentuates the naturally rubbery facets of peony. Thanks to a touch of lavender and galbanum, the suede or leather accord grows ashier, greener, and drier, the ghost of Tuscan Leather flickering at the edges. It is only after a while that one begins to notice the delicious creaminess of the base coming forward: damp jasmine petals pressed into spicy, milky tonka bean and the saltwater taffy of labdanum. All the while, Bruma retains a delightfully gauzy texture, which makes it an easy wear, even in hot weather. The lingering impression is of a fruity violet suede accord over dry ash, resin, and finally, the nutty, baked hay smell of tonka and vetiver. It is not the striding Valkyrie implied by the name; but for days when you want to smell just plain amazing rather than fierce, Bruma is the perfect choice."," black pepper, lavender, galbanum, violets, peony, iris, jasmine, labdanum, vetiver, tonka bean",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/55965.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, black pepper
Mortel Eau de Parfum,Cire Trudon," Mortel proves there's a reason why incense has been burned in churches for thousands of years: it just smells darned good. Yes, incense is used to purify the air and to rid places of worship of bad spirits. But the truth of the matter is that the scent of frankincense, labdanum, myrrh, and benzoin is almost universally pleasing. The question then becomes how to build an incense fragrance in a way that it stands out from countless others in the genre. Some use room-filling synthetics to lift the resins, some are dense and airless, and some are airy, bright  almost soapy. Mortel is a bone-dry, monastic take on the theme, differing from other entries in the field by being both wearable (in a casual, everyday sense) and supremely natural in feel. It skips entirely the lime-peel brightness of the topnotes of frankincense, plunging instead directly towards a heart of dark, waxy, smoked-out resin, with a vein of sizzling black pepper. The structure stacks churchy resins around a core of extremely dry labdanum, which here completely lacks the friendlier caramelic tones of its usual presentation. Myrrh, licorice-like and earthy, is particularly prominent, its dark oiliness underlined by a generous helping of nutmeg, pimento, and pepper. The toasty tones of Virginia cedar form a bridge between the dusty cistus in the heart to the powdery benzoin in the far dry-down. But, although Mortel is undeniably dry and austere, its dryness is organic, like the natural dustiness of soot or charcoal. Calming and meditative, it is an incense that will elevate the spirit without grinding the wearer down. Believe us, that's a hard balance to strike, and in our opinion, Mortel nails it."," Black pepper, pimento, nutmeg, frankincense, Virginia cedar, cistus, myrrh and benzoin",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/55967.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, black pepper
Olim Eau de Parfum,Cire Trudon," Olim, Latin for once', is supposed to evoke the excess and vanity of the French court under King Louis. And indeed, this is one pompadour of a fragrance, full of glittering powder, resin, golden bergamot, exotic spice, and intimate musks. Breathing this in, one might imagine the powdered wigs and sugary petit fours of Marie Antoinette, as well as the aromatic lavender waters splashed on by courtiers after their evening toilette. It is glittering, bold, and full-figured  an oriental with its corset stays loosened.We begin at the afternoon tea table of the young Queen and her adoring coquettes. A golden bergamot is doused heavily in powdered sugar, turning it from tart to fizzy and sweet: a lemon sherbet in fragrance form. Aromatic herbs in the heart sparkle  dewy lavender and anise, turning the air violet as the gentlemen drench their wigs and clothes to freshen them. But there is something sensual and skin-like underneath the bright elements, a combination of creamy musk, clove, and patchouli giving the lavender and bergamot a naughty Jicky edge. The deliberate clashing of citrus and cream, aromatics and resin, well  that's the classic recipe for when you want to do an oriental right. And Olim gets it right. If you love the warm sexiness of big-boned orientals such as Shalimar, Musc Ravageur, and Opus 1144, then Olim ought to give you a thrill."," bergamot, lavender, anise, pink pepper, clove, patchouli, benzoin, myrrh, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/55968.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Woman in Gold Eau de Parfum,By Kilian," The Austrian Mona Lisa glows not with an ambiguous smile, but in gorgeous golden patterns, motifs, and flushed rosy cheeks. Gustav Klimt's 1907 portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer is one of the most famous of his erotic gold-leaf paintings. By Kilian's Woman In Gold conjures a similar sensuality and play between light and shadow through a delicate rose as seen through unctuous vanilla and exquisite woods. Woman in Gold glows from the onset, with a tart bergamot and ripe mandarin, blended into soft-focus by a warm vanillic tonka bean. A sweet silken rose slowly blooms, petals lifting, whipped to a velvety froth, but with a darkness within, hinted at by gentle layers of oud and patchouli, seamlessly adjoined. The result is a perfume as complex and dazzling as the woman who wears it."," bergamot, mandarin, geranium, rose, patchouli, oud, tonka bean",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/425100.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Gold Knight Eau de Parfum,By Kilian," Inspired by the dashing, golden-armored chevalier in Gustav Klimt's 1902 Beethoven Frieze, By Kilian's Gold Knight flows with a similar golden opulence. The dark sensuousness of patchouli is draped in deep, golden honey, as Kilian Hennessy is wont to do. But despite the gourmand connotations, a fresh anisic bite adds an invigorating masculine edge for the Gold Knight - most distinctively paired with a bright, dry bergamot in the opening. As the scent grows darker, the honeyed patchouli shimmers with cinnamon, vanilla, and anise into a warm, sexy powerhouse.A magnificent collector's edition coffret, beautifully embellished in homage to artist Gustav Klimt's unique signature style and masterful use of gold leaf. Once opened, the mirrored zamac lid inside reflects the luminosity, mysterious glamour, and jewel-like quality of each bottle."," Bergamot, anise, patchouli, vanilla, cinnamon and honey",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/425101.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Eau My Soul Eau de Parfum,4160 Tuesdays," While the internet can be a nasty, spiteful, ungenerous place (to say the very least), we're delighted to report that fragrance lovers, by and large, are the exact opposite- which explains the success of many supportive, loving private communities of perfume aficionados online, including Christi Long's Eau My Soul. To celebrate this island of positivity, 4160's Sarah McCartney offered EMS's members a rare chance- vote on their top 25 favorite notes, and she would blend them together into a magnum opus of fragrance. Lo and behold, the votes were cast, and Sarah delivered with Eau My Soul, the newest and most democratic of releases from 4160 Tuesdays.Working primarily from sandalwood and amber, the top two vote-getters, Eau My Soul is an exuberant delight, or as Sarah herself describes it, a ""warm, friendly, inclusive group hug"" of a scent. A fresh bust of early citrus quickly warms into smooth, creamy woods and amber, giving off the delectable vibe of sparkling root beer. As lush florals blend seamlessly with musk, tobacco and honeyed leather, we can't help but think of sinking into a well-worn easy chair in our favorite pajamas, warmed by an unpretentiously casual mixed drink and a bite of our favorite dessert. We know Eau My Soul is named for the community that launched it. But even if it weren't, the name fits too well to think it could be called anything else."," Bergamot, lavender, honey, frankincense, cognac, sandalwood, rose, jasmine, orris, myrrh, tobacco, amber, oakmoss, vanilla, benzoin, musk, patchouli, vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64622.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Berlin Eau de Parfum,Gallivant," It's Berlin - think carefree summers, swimming at the Strandbad Wannsee with fresh water hitting the skin. Gritty urban living in brutalist apartment blocks, concrete, elegant parquet floors. Modern bohemians in leather, smoke, spices, cups of black tea, inside and underground. A city where you can be decadent, poor-but-sexy. Berlin is a play of light and dark, opening with zingy top notes of grapefruit, clementine, and lemon, all the rinds glistening with oils. There's a zip from schinus molle  a piquant flushed fruit akin to pink pepper. An airy black tea leads the transition from the spicy-fresh to the darker underbelly of cedarwood and Haitian vetiver. Perfectly disheveled with a level of edge, Gallivant's Berlin transports you to the defiant, provocative heart of the city."," Grapefruit, clementine, lemon, schinus molle co2 extract, black pepper, black tea, Haitian vetiver, cedarwood, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76605.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, grapefruit
Ambra Extrait de Parfum,Jeroboam," Taking on an olfactory family this well known is no small feat. It's a testament of perfumer Vanina Murraciole's originality and creativity that Ambra manages to whisk amber away from the staid and into a sensual, modern, androgynous realm. From the onset, Ambra enters a billowing vanilla, full of sweet cream and lifted up with a peppery-fresh duo of bergamot and geranium. It's fluffy, almost airy -- but there's a darkness around the edges, discreetly smoldering with patchouli and incense. Once Peru balsam kicks in, it's a veritable amber, but shape-shifting, nonetheless. Wrapped in the seductive energy of Jeroboam's enigmatic musks, with hints of of smoke in the distance, this amber on the brink of gourmand might just tip us over."," Bergamot, geranium, incense, peru balsam, patchouli, vetiver, vanilla, tonka bean, enigmatic musks",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/71408.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Mosaic Eau de Parfum,Mosaic," Just as artists combine individual geometric tiles to form a sprawling work mesmerizing tessellation in the Zellige style, Mosaic Eau de Parfum combines some of North and Western's Africa's most fragrant raw ingredients, all beautifully accessible on their own, into something opulent, complex and otherworldly.Mosaic opens with a heady dry oud, tinged with hints of apple and cherry tobacco. As the cool, spicy oud mellows, it mingles with a heart of authentic, lush vanilla. Earthy notes of cedar, sandalwood and musk ground the base as they softly emerge throughout the dry-down. The ultimate effect is something rich, warm and romantic."," Vanilla, oud, musk, cedarwood and sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/78300.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, vanilla
Elysium Pour Homme Extrait de Parfum,Roja Parfums," Drawn from Greek legend, the Elysian Fields are the eternal reward of the heroic and virtuous, a heaven accessible only to those of the highest character and accomplishment. With such lofty inspiration as background, and the sophisticated opulence of Roja Dove in control, we were expecting great things from Elysium. Now that we've smelled its fresh, warm, confident blend of musks, fruits, leather and woods, we're delighted to confirm that it's destined to become a new masculine classic. From the opening notes, it's clear that Elysium was designed to stand out, as it features a uniquely engineered use of musk as a top note, which combines with the ultra-fresh blend of energetic citrus and aromatic lavender for a beginning as smooth as it is fresh. A juicy, sweet dose of fruit in the heart pairs perfectly with spicy woods, balancing striking liveliness with richly masculine sophistication. And in the exquisite drydown, sensual leather and soft vanilla give strength and longevity while a reprise of musk lends a dreamlike warmth that more than lives up to the ambitious name. Like the Elysian Fields themselves, one must prove himself worthy of a fragrance this outstanding. But for those who are deserving, Elysium is a reward unlike any other."," Lemon, bergamot, grapefruit, lime, lavender, thyme, artemisia, musk, lily of the valley, rose de mai, jasmine, apple, blackcurrant, galbanum, pink pepper, cypriol, vetiver, cedarwood, juniper, benzoin, vanilla, labdanum, leather, ambergris, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/74836.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, lemon
Suede Osmanthe Eau de Parfum,"Pierre Guillaume Paris, Parfumerie Generale"," When Pierre Guillaume reworks a fragrance, he does so from the bottom up  if L'Eau de Circe was his fruity paeon to the peachy osmanthus, Suede Osmanthe is its dark, mysterious cousin whose true identity is in question. Osmanthus is a most bewitching flower, its elegant petals often scenting the rice fields of China with their potently smoky, fruity fragrance. In Suede Osmanthe, the delicate flower's seductive contrasts are deconstructed and magnified to gorgeous effect.The first surprise comes in the fresh, lilting fizz of aldehydes - herbaceously floral and soapy-clean, the bubbles float and tug at the surface of a just-ripened apricot, and the fuzzy skin lets out small whiffs of the sweet fruit within. In a most natural transition, apricot skin melts into soft, cozy suede, and leathery Suederal radiates with the black tea leaves in a smoky embrace. The notes suddenly ring perfectly of a sleek osmanthus, slimmed down to its essentials. The illusion completes itself in a wave of silky musks, androgynous and mysterious. It's a chic illusion, as there's no actual osmanthus here, but as with the most beautiful sleight-of-hand, you'll fall in love anyway."," Aldehydes, black tea, osmanthus, apricot, Suederal, Cashmeran, musks",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/34553.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, aldehydes
Patchouli Sublime Elixir de Parfum,PARFUMS DE NICOLAI," In keeping with the legacy of Nicolai, Patchouli Sublime elevates the most classic material used in perfumery, patchouli, and reveals its sumptuous qualities, both verdant and smooth. Patchouli Sublime's appeal is in how the exquisite blend unfolds, starting from its high-altitude crisp beginning. If we were to compare it to its predecessor, Patchouli Intense, we would call them cousins  one of the earth, one of the sky.  Minty and green, a fresh lavender sets a classic stage for Patchouli Sublime, sparkling from its mountaintop. The pure, cool air, lifted with mint and coriander, introduces a dance of rosy geranium and soft, herbaceous patchouli to the scene. It's a regal pairing, and Parfums de Nicolai celebrates this time-honored union to, dare we say, sublime perfection. The patchouli never goes earthy, and instead, unfurls into a richly green, textured symphony, with the lavender in tow, all the way to the heart. The complexity and longevity of Patchouli Sublime reigns supreme, and as it melts into the skin, it's actually musky. And for once, Patchouli Sublime joins the mortal souls in their corporeal delights, and graces us with a clean yet gorgeously earthy, sensual musk. We couldn't imagine a classic tale better told."," Lavender, mint, coriander, geranium, rose, tonka bean, tobacco,  patchouli, musk, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/31357.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, lavender
Tubereuse Absolue Eau de Parfum,Perris Monte Carlo," Tuberose,  tuberose  what can we say about the belle of the ball? When she enters,  all eyes are on the sultry white flower in one fell swoop. With TubÃ©reuse Absolue,  Perris Monte Carlo follows the flower to her origin,  the Aztec civilization. There,  she was called Oximochitl,  orbone flower,  for her long white blossoms and delicate waxy petals. TubÃ©reuse Absolue pays tribute to the grand dame and the lineage of perfumery inspired by her charms. A fanfare of bright spices announces her arrival,  with cardamom leading the way,  and a glint of bergamot and lavender provide the spotlight. A grand tuberose,  long white petals sweeping the floor,  makes her radiant entrance,  gracious yet coy. Her intoxicating aroma is a slow reveal here,  and she keeps her indolic cards close to her chest. Handmaids jasmine and gardenia are by her side,  but they know never to overshadow the star. This is a most sophisticated tuberose,  not green or minty,  but clean,  luminous and creamy,  with enough woodsy richness to steal your heart. As her luscious white petals unfold,  they impart an almost suede-like buttery texture,  and a base of warm cedarwood shows just how deep her beauty goes. How could we resistla belle dame sans merci  the beautiful lady without mercy?"," Bergamot, cardamom, lavender, galbanum, tuberose, broom, jasmin sambac, gardenia, orange blossom, cedar, vetiver, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70211.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Layton EXCLUSIF Eau de Parfum,Parfums de Marly," When we first heard that Parfums de Marly had a new version of their cult favorite Layton, we admit we were at a bit of a loss: how could they possibly improve on the fruity, spicy, gloriously lively luxuriousness of this ode to the splendor of Versailles? Now that we have it in our hands, we're pleased to announce this is no mere flanker. Instead, perhaps inspired by Marie Antoinette's extensive remodeling of the palace and grounds in the 18th century, Marly has rebuilt Layton from the ground up, delivering a companion piece to the fresh, sporty original that surrounds the signature blend of fruits and spices with deep, animalic woods and resins for a darkly seductive experience. In Layton Exclusif, a heavy dose of civet hums through the rich floral heart, delivering a new layer of sensuality. And the already opulent vanilla and woods base is further enhanced, with resinous amber and an alluringly powerful coffee note to invigorate the senses and heighten the passion. Does Layton Exclusif take the place of our beloved Layton? It's not meant to. Instead, we think of the two as the ultimate pair- Layton, a gentleman's perfect match for a day of royal festivities, and Layton Exclusif, a dangerously seductive secret weapon when day turns to evening."," Bergamot, mandarin, water accord, grapefruit, rose, geranium, waterlily, gardenia, civet, cardamom, sandalwood, gaiac, amber, pink pepper, vanilla, coffee, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70024.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Figment Man Eau de Parfum,Amouage," A new release from Amouage is always reason to celebrate, but when a fragrance as unique as Figment arrives, we can truly appreciate just how special the venerable Omani house can be. Rich with contrast, dreamlike in its serenity, Figment Man draws exquisite florals, woods and animalics together to create an utterly original, rapturously imaginative men's scent that will challenge and delight in equal measure. Opening with fresh, tranquil notes of lemon, geranium, and pink pepper, Figment then moves into a luminous heart of sandalwood that entwines dramatically with leather-inflected, smokily animalic elements evoking primal secrets and ancient traditions. As the base emerges, intoxicatingly balsamic strokes of labdanum and guaiac wed the earthly to the mystical with sublime grace. Inspired by the wondrous Kingdom of Bhutan, where the mountains meet the sky, Figment Man is an apt testament to one of the few places on earth where magic and mystery still reign."," Lemon, geranium, pink pepper, sandalwood, animalic accord, vetiver, labdanum, guaiac, earth accord",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/41886.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, lemon
Champs de Provence Eau de Parfum,Eight and Bob," A new Eight and Bob scent is more than just a fragrance; it's a voyage to through the early 20th century's most beautiful and glamorous locales, through the eyes of perfumer and aristocrat Albert Fouquet. With Champs de Provence, Fouquet whisks us away to a charming stretch of French countryside, where Europe's rich and beautiful leave the bustle of city life behind to unwind in rustic villas, surrounded by the beautiful abundance of nature in full bloom. And full bloom is exactly what this delightfully fresh, disarmingly casual scent delivers. Featuring a sumptuous bouquet of crisp, juicy fruits and wonderfully lush florals, held together with a surprisingly sexy base of musk and mate, Champs de Provence lets us feel like we're strolling through an untouched meadow, the heat of the midday sun unlocking the aromas of the thousands of wild plants native to this unspoiled paradise. With its intoxicating freshness, it's the perfect casual gentlemen's scent- but we have no doubt that it would smell every bit as stunning on a lady with a taste for the great outdoors."," Bergamot, orange, pear, jasmine, rose, orange blossom, musk, mate, ambroxan",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/63907.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Monsieur Beauregard Eau de Parfum,Penhaligons,"Our French friend is how this unknown but over-familiar houseguest Monsieur Beauregard is typically introduced. His lingering gaze lets you know he'll take things from here. A special kind of perfection that with its strong caressing silence speaks volumes! Confidently quiet, and mysteriously sexy, Monsieur Beauregard's namesake fragrance opens with subtle vivacity, a silky burst of pink pepper, lemon, and spicy cinnamon. But this dashing young French heir never gives it all away  the veil of mystery is always there, in a creamy base of orris and enough woodsy musk to make your knees weak. The warm benzoin and tonka is downright seductive, with the most French allure we've seen out of the Penhaligons Portraits series. Masculine, musky, and sexy, it's a statement made in one dramatic glance  one look is all it takes."," Lemon, pink pepper, orris, cinnamon, benzoin, sandalwood, tonka bean, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/441021.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, lemon
The Bewitching Yasmine Eau de Parfum,Penhaligons," The Bewitching Yasmine is by all appearances soft and quiet. Yet at the same time, she conducts herself with a rare force. Some, the less determined, would find her distant, maybe cold, but appearances are notoriously misleading. Like many intriguing (and bewitching) women, the perfume of Yasmine is hot and cold. The unique sharpness of rich, strong coffee is set off against a creamy spice accord, complete with aromatic cardamom. Hers is an ambition that doesn't look back, and she has the allure to match - billowing white vanilla, honeyed with hints of jasmine catch your attention. As you lean in for more, a wisp of incense floats away, with a mysterious note of Laotian oud. The  Bewitching Yasmine is a rare beauty with a a one-way ticket, and if you're lucky, you'll be the one to fall under her charm."," Cardamom, coffee, jasmine sambac, incense, white vanilla, Tahitian vanilla, Laos oud",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/441023.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, cardamom
The Ruthless Countess Dorothea Eau de Parfum,Penhaligons," The Ruthless Countess Dorothea is a most ferocious matriarch, known for her sharp mind, even sharper wit and a secret fondness for the company of young men and scones! She knows how to host and receive, with impeccable manners, without question. And her scent is similarly refined, reassuring  but you can't help but notice the surreptitious flame. She opens with  a hit of uplifting citrus bergamot that recalls the finest Earl Grey tea. Drink deeper, and you notice the honeyed spice in the air, with red ginger and cinnamon. It's deliciously wearable, with an inviting, creamy vanilla like buttery scones at tea-time. But don't get too comfortable - the furtive glances belie the cozy gourmands - for it seems there's some sherry in the tea and always, the potential of new romance."," Bergamot, red ginger, cinnamon, beeswax, clary sage, mate, vanilla, sherry, cashmere wood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/441024.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Histoire D'Orangers Eau de Parfum,L'Artisan Parfumeur," This newest offering from L'Artisan Parfumeur is a radiant tribute to the perfumer Marie Salagmagne's travels in the valley of Souss, at the foothills of the Anti-Atlas in Morocco. Remembering the sunset atop the earth walls of the Taroudant, the warm light intensifying the colors of the raw land, she remarks,Each time I think of this majestic landscape, I think of orange tree flower water. A delicate and delicious water, ultra-refreshing and incredibly luminous.Histoires D'Orangers is truly a story of oranges sublimated into a most delicate and pure flower water. From its sparkling white tea and verdant neroli beginning, to the gorgeously evocative orange blossom fluffed in glistening mineral ambroxan, it is a gentle, exquisite fragrance, through and through. There's much to revel in, when the subtleties are revealed - whether it's the musk that achieves a triple-milled purity that's never overtly soapy, or the light almond-like hint of tonka beans  the end result is like a feeling more than anything  like silk on skin, warmed by the sun."," Neroli, orange blossom, white tea, musk, tonka bean, ambroxan",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/152019.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, neroli
Au Bord De L'Eau Eau de Cologne,L'Artisan Parfumeur," Inspired by the signature work of Claude Monet, Au Bord de l'Eau uses raw olfactive materials as if they were paint pigments. Contours are suggested, not defined, in the watery waves.Like Monet's masterpiece, we alternate between the realism of the zest of bergamot and lemon - its freshness is mixed with the petals of the bitter orange - and the more complex texture nestled below. The mist of sparkling citrus rests on the green and woody undertones of rosemary, violet, and soft musk. A cologne painted in pointillism."," Bergamot, lemon, violet, musk, orange blossom, rosemary",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/152020.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Delina Eau de Parfum,Parfums de Marly," Composed by Guerlain-trained perfumer Quentin Bisch, Delina is a floral bouquet, a fragrant tribute to feminity and sensuality. Housed in a gorgeously soft pink bottle with pink tassels to boot, the polished, delicate character is apparent from the beginning. It opens brightly with sweet, juicy lychee and softly tangy rhubarb, but these tart fruits aren't sharp in the least, and serve only to provide lift with a wink. It is the posh lily of the valley, regal Turkish rose, and fresh peony that form the beautiful feminine heart. Creamy and undulating with vanilla and white musk, Delina is flawlessly blended to soft, sumptuous delight."," Bergamot, lychee, rhubarb, nutmeg, Turkish rose, vanilla, musk, Haitian vetiver, cedar, frankincense, cashmeran",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70023.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Midnight Special Eau de Parfum,Ex Nihilo," In the enchanting world of traditional Arabian perfumery, a mukhallat is a perfume created from a blend of pure fragrance oils, perfected over centuries but still open to the creator's personal touch. With Midnight Special, Olivier Pescheux transposes the mukhallat to a more Parisian format- the eau de parfum- keeping the focus on exceptional natural materials, but re-imagining it as a nocturnal elixir, with traditional elements of oud, rose, patchouli and spice given a cosmopolitan twist with a unique accord of rose jelly. The results are dynamic- dark, sensually smoky oud and luscious florals shine through, but the mouthwatering jelly accord, with its strong grapefruit facets, invigorates and energizes the heart notes, making an ancient formula feel vitally youthful. And a deep, rich and evocative base of oud and smooth, balanced vanilla lasts for untold hours, ensuring that the wearer will be turning heads well into the morning. Exotic, stylish and drop dead sexy, Midnight Special is a cross-cultural knockout that may inspire you to do some nighttime mingling of your own."," Black pepper, cinnamon, saffron, rose, rose jelly accord, grapefruit, oud, patchouli, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/72019.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, black pepper
Ta'if Eau de Parfum,Ormonde Jayne," Ta'if roses have to hustle to survive in a hostile growing environment, high up on the plains of a rocky region near Mecca in Saudi Arabia. Mirroring its harsh environment, the Ta'if rose yields oil that is almost as extreme in its biting greenness and peppery spiciness. To complement its obstinate and proud character, Linda Pilkington chose to surround the rose with an array of exciting Arabianflavors, such as saffron and dates - the saffron adding a mysterious, iodine-like touch of leather, the dates adding a juicy sweetness that gives the texture a satisfying, toffee-like chew. Ta'if is simply breathtaking. At first sharp and spicy with pepper, the rose note soon emerges in all its pushy, exotic beauty, like a Ta'if rose itself erupting through the rocky, arid soil of the Mecca plains. Later dusted heavily with bitter saffron and softened with a soapy freesia, the rose relaxes into a comfortable, peachy tone that is as unexpected as it is joyful. Orange blossom and dates add a fudgy sweetness that nudges the rose towards a Persian sweetmeat, giving the fragrance a jellied lokhoum feel. Ta'if is never thick or leaden in its exotic sweetness, however, because little wafts of gorse bush-like broom cut through the ambered heft of the base to provide lift and air. A pleasure to wear and smell, Ta'if is a gust of authentic desert air, full of spicy rose, orange blossom, and honeyed Arabian treats. Try it and be transported to another world."," Saffron, dates, pink pepper, freesia, ta'if rose, jasmine, orange blossom, broom, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77710.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, saffron
Champaca Eau de Parfum,Ormonde Jayne," Centered on a green tea accord with a squeeze of zesty lemon, Champaca is as squeaky clean as a freshly-scrubbed face. It is especially good in hot weather, when the papery coolness of the neroli, bamboo, and green tea steps forward to soothe ruffled tempers and restore internal peace. Stirred into this frosty glass of ice tea is a scant teaspoon's worth of basmati rice: subtle but present, it provides just enough cloudy milkiness to take the sting out of the green tea.Champaca is unusual in that it's a floral fragrance that doesn't smell too much of flowers, let alone the titular one. There is a hint of peppery freesia, but it comes across more as clean linen than a flower. Likewise, there is a lot of waxy, yellow champaca blossom here, but only really perceptible as a burst of something lemony and creamy, like magnolia with an undertow of dusky honey. The flowers simply melt into the basmati rice accord to form a subtly peppery creaminess that relieves the sharp, tannic twang of the green tea and citruses. There is something ineffably charming about Champaca  it is rather hard to pin down, but its pearlized, milky freshness gives it all the delicacy of the inside of a conch shell. As sensual as clean skin, we highly recommend Champaca as a soft, slightly milky floral oriental that will enchant in even the hottest of weather."," Neroli, pink pepper, bamboo, champaca absolute, basmati rice, freesia, musk, green tea",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77702.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, neroli
Isfarkand Eau de Parfum,Ormonde Jayne," Isfarkand is a mysterious thing. Its structure is simple and relatively linear  peppery citruses over grassy vetiver and radiant woods  but it transmits such a laid-back, uncluttered appeal that you'll find yourself wondering if there's more to it than meets the eye. Ormonde Jayne's signature opening notes of pink pepper and citrus burn even brighter than normal here, giving the scent the exciting zestiness of a freshly-peeled lime. The peppery spice hugs the toasty cedar and vetiver tightly, the result being a close-knit mÃ©lange of clean woods, citrus, grass, and spice that is so pleasurable to wear that it doesn't really make sense to try and pick it apart.Isfarkand is as easy to wear as a favorite shirt, so don't be surprised if you find yourself reaching for it, again and again, even over fragrances that you think you like better. It sounds simple - and it is - but somehow a certain Ormonde Jayne magic ties it all together, making it one of the classiest and most versatile everyday options for the modern man. As a subtle, my-skin-but-better woody vetiver for all seasons, Isfarkand is hard to beat."," Lime, mandarin orange, bergamot, pink pepper, cedar, iris, vetiver, oakmoss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77704.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, lime
Ormonde Woman Eau de Parfum,Ormonde Jayne," Ormonde Jayne Woman is one of those fragrances that are almost impossible to describe using the listed notes, because it only makes sense when explained as an atmosphere or a feeling. For example, we might be able to tell you that this scent contains cardamom, coriander, and the witchy-sounding black hemlock, but we're at a loss as to explain how or why the sum of this simple list of materials is a whole forest from The Brothers Grimm, complete with Hansel and Gretel, and Baba Yaga waiting in her smoky gingerbread house. And yet, it truly is.First, a forest's worth of pungent green herbs and grasses is unfurled beneath your feet, the dark shadows of poison ivy and European oaks swallowing up all the natural daylight at the edges. This velveteen, viridian carpet is dotted with moist, sweet little violets and jasmine petals, their frilly innocence incongruous against the sinister background of forest woods. Ormonde Jayne Woman is a deeply coniferous scent with a fair amount of bitterness, but what really tugs at the heartstrings is its errant thread of sweetness - that smoky, spicy amber note that weaves through the perfume like a siren call to tempt children and adults alike. One of the rare perfumes that truly deserves its reputation asmysterious, we defy you to wear this and not be shaken and stirred."," Cardamom, coriander, grass oil, black hemlock, violet, jasmine, vetiver, cedar, amber, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77706.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, cardamom
Santo Incienso Extrait de Parfum,The Different Company," Originally released as Le15,  a one-time limited offering to celebrate The Different Company's 15-year anniversary of distinguished creations,  Santo Incensio  Sillage SacrÃ© is exactly the same formulation released under a new name for a new life. Described asA sacred perfume that draws its secret from shamanic stances,  like a prayer to the sky,  it showcases the supreme holy wood rarely used in perfumery,  palo santo.The opening spark is a bright flame,  both tart and smoky,  invoking the beginning of ritual. Fizzy orbs of bergamot and petitgrain crackle with delicate shavings of nutmeg,  fragrant and spicy. At the same time,  a vetiver-infused plume of smoke rises,  and palo santo makes its entrance. This is the sacred wood elevated to high chic,  a far cry from rustic bundles of wood - more like a glowing,  elegant veil with meditative grounding. Here,  the enchanting,  contradictory facets of palo santo are deftly highlighted  the citric effervescence,  piney cool,  and minty lightness. A supporting note of balsamic Atlas cedar adds to the creamy-yet-shimmering wood. A wood that releases its healing,  cleansing scent when burned,  it is unlike any other,  with pale smoke tendrils rising in subtle shades of incense and myrrh. As this soothing scent develops,  you can really feel the mastery of Alexandra Monet,  who's devised a way to approximate the feel of a holy incense that burns to clean white ash - leaving just a wisp of sacred smoke on the skin. Mystical,  yet contemporary and wholly fresh."," Bergamot, petitgrain, nutmeg, palo santo, Atlas cedar, Hedione, incense, myrrh, musks",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/25342.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Dragonfly Eau de Parfum,Zoologist," Drifting through swaying reeds and billowing stalks of papyrus, a breeze gives chase to a sweet morning mist. A perfect mirror, revealed upon still green water, is shattered by a sudden shower, casting the gentle romance of lotus and iris into a frenzied, passionate rhythm. High above, tendrils of sunlight nudge away the grey clouds, their warmth drawing dense aromas from the dewy surfaces below. Beneath the dwindling ripples, restless nymphs stir and begin to emerge. Under the soft moonlight, the newly-hatched dragonflies spread fragile, virgin wings, poised to explore the world between pool and sky.Like a glade captured in delicate strokes upon an impressionist canvas, the rich, green floral medley of Zoologist Dragonfly transports you through a maze of moody tones and melancholy weather. This olfactory journey echoes the cycle of a cobalt pond, from the crackling light of dawn to the thick blanket of nightfall, under the gaze of the flitting dragonfly."," Aldehydes, Heliotrope, Lemon, Peony, Rainwater, Cherry Blossom, Clover, Iris, Lotus, Rice, Amber, Moss, Musk, Papyrus, Sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76015.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, aldehydes
Le Sillage Blanc Eau de Parfum,Dusita," Inspired by Piguet's Bandit, Sillage Blanc is a modern chypre with a retro soul. This is Bandit with better manners and an independent streak of its own. With its bright herbal opening, Sillage Blanc is a chypre-leather riff, fresh, alternately crisp and mossy. Bandit's sharp greenness and fierce leather are there, but the rough edges have been smoothed out. Where Bandit is an emerald-eyed dominatrix cracking a horsewhip, Sillage Blanc is an urban garconne sporting a Kelly leather bag.Sillage Blanc opens with smack of bright green galbanum sharp as a nip-waisted suit. But soapy-sweet neroli soon tones down the galbanum bite, and orange blossom adds a touch of creamy florals. Sillage Blanc is not, however, simply Bandit's more genteel sibling. Little Sis has a naughty side of her own. A green, moist tobacco note adds an earthy, illicit quality. The bitter herbal notes are distinctive, amped up with artemisia and a vegetal ambrette before settling down on a mossy, woodsy bed. Completely unisex, Sillage Blanc is like a well-made Campari cocktail held by a gloved hand bitter, leathery perfection."," Orange blossom, Neroli, Tobacco, Artemisia, Galbanum, Leather, Ambrette seed, Patchouli, Oakmoss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/74604.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, orange blossom
Vespero Parfum Extrait,Jeroboam," A resolutely masculine extract dedicated to dandyish urban night owls, Vespero is the scent of a never-ending evening of pleasures both sophisticated and decidedly wicked. Your night begins with a swoon of rich, vibrant fruits, lent a darker, sexier edge with a refined heart of cedarwood and geranium. As richer, long-lasting notes of leather and patchouli emerge, the fragrance has gone from sunny to sensual, with smoky and earthy facets asserting themselves alongside the exquisitely musky base that makes the unified signature of all Jeroboam scents. Dark enough to seduce, bright enough to charm, and versatile enough for adventures big and small, Vespero is the perfect accessory for an imperfect gentleman."," Bergamot, apple, pink grapefruit, cedarwood, geranium, leather, jasmine, patchouli, ambery woods, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/71407.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Santal Complet Eau de Parfum,Fragrance du Bois," Tantalizingly tropical yet softly sensual, Santal Complet is a gorgeous new sandalwood scent that proves that Fragrance du Bois can do far more than just oud scents. In fact, by emphasizing the smooth, creamy, indulgent side of sandalwood with coconut, musk and vanilla, Santal Complet is a world away from the house's previous offerings, one that has us dreaming of white sand beaches and undisturbed crystal clear turquoise waters at the edge of the world.Santal Complet opens with the aforementioned coconut note, one of the best we've ever smelled: the perfect balance between refreshing and creamy, with a zingy patina of fresh lemon and black pepper. As the beautiful, multifaceted sandalwood warms up, we find it's the perfect companion for the coconut- gently sweet, creamy, and a blend of warm and cool tonalities that feel exactly like the afternoon sun hitting your still-wet-from-the-ocean-skin, with supporting notes of amber and vanilla supplementing without overwhelming. Plenty of scents promise vacation ambiance, but if you're seeking a getaway of unparalleled luxury, Santal Complet is uniquely qualified to soothe your wanderlust.Note: Santal Complet ""Parfum"" is an ""Eau de Parfum"" concentration, same original concentration as before. Parfum is only meant to be viewed a design reference on the label."," Lemon, coconut, violet, black pepper, musk, sandalwood, amber, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/75710.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, lemon
Hacivat Extrait de Parfum,Nishane," Move over, because there's a new masculine in town, and guys, you're going to love this one. With tart, sparkling citrus draped over a backbone crisp with forest woods, oakmoss, and white jasmine, Hacivat recalls the oakmoss-laden glory of woody chypres like Pour Monsieur that once populated men's perfumery. Despite the solidly classical lines of the scent, Hacivat feels entirely modern, with a juicy pineapple note aerating the damp mosses and woods, and a touch of blackcurrant leaf keeping the tone fresh and outdoorsy. Don't be afraid of that pineapple note. Rich and natural-smelling rather than sporty or cheap, the pineapple note is so well done here that it redeems the reputation of the much-maligned fruit. Hacivat wears on the skin as lightly as a white linen shirt in summer. It is discreet, professional, and sparklingly clean, but possessed of just enough bitter moss and woods for gravitas. A rare, classically-built woody chypre with a contemporary edge, Hacivat just smells really wonderful and will make other people think you smell great too. Bookmark this scent if you love a modern classic."," Bergamot, pineapple, grapefruit, jasmine, patchouli, cedar, woody notes, oakmoss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77418.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Zenne Extrait de Parfum,Nishane," Zenne is a tribute in fragrance form to one of the stock characters in Ottoman Empire shadow plays  a woman whose voluptuous beauty is capable of bringing men to their knees. And Zenne the fragrance is every bit as self-confident, flirtatious, and pretty as the character it emulates. Think of the softest, rosiest blackcurrant musk you can imagine, glazed with milky musk and turned into a cloud of pink marshmallows, and that is Zenne.It begins in the palace garden, with a volley of pink grapefruit, rhubarb, and blackcurrant leaf, tart with morning dew. It is innocent, yet juicy and seductive. Slowly, piquant blackcurrants begin to pop against a cloudy backdrop of milky sandalwood, musk, and gardenia, staining the cream with purple juice. In the midst of all this, a rich Turkish rose ripens, slicking the tart, starchy berries and rhubarb with rose syrup, and adding body and thickness to the scent. A nugget of salty, chewy ambergris in the base extends the golden glow of the scent, giving it the sexy insolence for which the character of Zenne is known. Zenne is both innocent and come-hither  whipped up into a gentle pink froth of tart berries, creamy musks, and rich red roses, it presents an appeal that's hard to resist."," Grapefruit, blackcurrant (cassis), rhubarb, Turkish rose, gardenia, sandalwood, vanilla, ambergris, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77420.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, grapefruit
Hundred Silent Ways Extrait de Parfum,Nishane," Inspired by a line in a poem by Rumi, the 13th century Sufi poet,I closed my mouth and spoke to you in a hundred silent ways"", Hundred Silent Ways communicates love wordlessly through a series of little flourishes of fruit and flowers as tender as the skin of a loved one. There is an undeniably girlish flirtatiousness about Hundred Silent Ways, but it is also very elegant.The opening is ambrosial and frankly sensual, a Rococo burst of sweet, syrupy peaches, mandarin orange, and tuberose petals so juicy sweet that you will want to gulp it down greedily, heedless of the red juice staining your mouth. Bathed in a cloud of marshmallow-soft musk, the fruit and flowers slowly become more abstract and hazier in feel, but thanks to a touch of cool, powdery iris, it never loses its sparkle. By the time you get to the nutty, savory woodiness of the sandalwood in the base, soaking up all the rich, buttery excesses of gardenia, fruit, and cream, you will have been completely won over by the inviting deliciousness of Hundred Silent Ways. It is the rare fruity floral that seduces you without so much as a word."," Mandarin, tuberose, peach, white jasmine, gardenia, orris, vanilla, sandalwood, vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77401.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, mandarin
Ambra Calabria Extrait de Parfum,Nishane," Ambra Calabria is an unusually fresh, leafy-green amber that departs from the standard model of vanilla and resin so thick you could stand a spoon up in em. The sour bite of Calabrian bergamot and the smoky greenness of the galbanum cut a swath through the amber, blowing it up with salt and air. This is what makes Ambra Calabria such a fantastic wear in hot summer weather.But Ambra Calabria really gives you the best of both worlds. It has all the spiky freshness of a traditional eau de cologne but also all the robustness of a full-blown oriental. So while the opening act is full of tart green and lemony notes that will snap your head to attention, the second act is built for comfort, not speed, with creamy jasmine blossoms tucked behind the ear of a musky, salted caramel base that seems to go on forever. Sweet and inviting on the bottom, tart and energizing on top, Ambra Calabria is the olfactory equivalent of Key Lime pie with a sprinkle of anise and salt on top. Summer in a bottle, dare we say."," Bergamot, galbanum, green leaves, jasmine, coriander, sweet amber, musk, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77405.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Slow Explosions Eau de Parfum,Imaginary Authors,"I was lost,  aimless,  and depressed. Now I'm only two of those things.-Gwen K. VroomenIn 1980,  Gwen K. Vroomen quit a monotonous job,  went to the corner bar,  and  on the bartender's urging  threw a dart at a world map tacked on the wall. She had never heard of Goa but knew immediately she needed to go. Three months later she was celebrating Hindu New Year at a tea garden high in the hills of Kerala,  fireworks exploding below. She wrote of that night:I was resuscitated by color,  redeemed by the vibrant unknown. Her self-proclaimedJourney out of darkness,  dotted with unforgettable stories of night markets,  river floats,  and harrowing moped rides,  inspired a generation of young Americans eager to buck the drudgery of ordinary life. With pops of rose and hits of saffron,  this scent explodes on the skin and awakens the senses. Every inhale will open you up to the idea of escape,  push you to take risks,  and embolden you to get truly lost.

Soda Eau de Toilette,Comme des Garcons: Olfactory Library," Fizzy! Uplifting! We can't help but put exclamation marks because Soda is genuinely happy, enough to make cave-dwelling goth boy or girl crawl out and frolic in the sunshine. Who cares if only a couple of ingredients are recognizable as being from this planet?  Soda is a bubbly, effervescent version of limeade with enough base (Galaxolide-it's a light musk, who knew?) to give it a perfect dose of grown-up depth. There's even a version of lily of the valley in here, which lends Soda a tiny bit of creamy softness. Tell us you don't smile (and make everyone else grin) when you wear this. We dare you."," Aldehydes, lime, citral, pimenal, lilial, iso-eugenol, galaxolide, acetal Rum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77206.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, aldehydes
Aprilis Parfum,Santa Eulalia," April- when the chill of winter begins to give way to the rebirth of spring. In Barcelona, this means the blooming of the April roses in the Parc de Cervantes, one of the world's most important rose gardens, housing 245 international varieties of this precious, gorgeous, romantic flower. In honor of this remarkable annual occasion, Santa Eulalia presents Aprilis, a gorgeously unique rose scent of unparalleled diversity and sophistication. Matching a deep, lush rose bouquet against a fresh pop of citrus, a spicy tang of star anise, and a rooty, rich iris, Aprilis is a portrait of a garden in full bloom, with the ebb and flow of early spring weather providing both contrast and comfort."," Bergamot, citrus, star anise, rose, iris, moss, woody notes",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77300.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Obscuro Parfum,Santa Eulalia," The ""darker"" side of Barcelona, Obscuro presents the great city in winter-  never truly wintry, but refreshingly crisp, with a sense of quiet calm that seems to encourage deep, almost mystical reflection. Built around a spiritual incense accord, spiked with anise and distinctive saffron, Obscuro deepens itself further with rich peru balsam, traces of leather, and a raw, animalic tinge of leather. Beautiful, spiritual and gently imposing, Obscuro is proof positive that ""dark"" need not mean bleak."," Incense, star anise, saffron, peru balsam, leather, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77304.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, incense
Noble VIII Immortelle Parfum Extrait,Clive Christian," New for 2017, the Noble VIII perfume pair encapsulates the charm, lyricism and style of the Rococo movement. In the masculine oriented offering, bright, refreshing bergamot opens the fragrance, while a heart of sweet immortelle is reinforced with a burst of exquisite spices. A base of rich, complex papyrus lends subtle but effective longevity with its mix of dry, woodsy facets, making this the perfect masculine scent for a fresh summer day. Of course, as with all of Clive Christian's exquisite masculine scents, this spicy, sweet and complex composition is not limited to men alone- simply put, it would be drop dead sexy on just about anyone."," Bergamot, immortelle, papyrus",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/58021.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
This Is Not A Blue Bottle Eau de Parfum,Histoires de Parfums," Histoires de Parfums has enchanted us for years with evocative scent stories meticulously set in carerfully chosen times and places. But for This Is Not A Blue Bottle, Gerald Ghislain felt compelled to move in the opposite direction and deliver a scent divorced from the usual trappings, a dadaist canvas both teeming with energy but also presented as a blank slate, where the interaction between the scent and the nose that experiences it is a full collaboration, free of preconceived conceptual bias. The resulting fragrance is intentionally hard to pin down, a vibrant yet layered unisex spicy floral with intense metallic aldehydes, sweet honey, and luminously warm ambered patchouli. The flacon itself is a object of beauty, the familiar yet striking angled Histoires de Parfums bottle redone in eye-popping matte blue, entirely opaque, inviting the wearer to invent his or her own story as soon as the perfume touches their skin- and not a moment before."," Aldehydes, orange zest, honey, geranium, musk, patchouli, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/57625.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, aldehydes
1828 Travel Spray Eau de Parfum,Histoires de Parfums," Jules VerneHe was born in Nantes, at the beginning of that century of discoveries. The close ocean took him far away, inspiring in him extraordinary novels of adventure. Inspired by the father of literary science fiction, this eau de parfum for modern globe-trotters breathes its aromatic Hesperides-like scents, just as a marine breeze over a wild heath. A freshness tinted with sophistication.This beloved niche scent is now available in a stylish, versatile 15ml spray bottle ideal for travel."," Grapefruit, Citrus, Tangerine, Eucalyptus, Nutmeg, Pepper, Cedar, Incense, Vetiver, Pinecone",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/57627.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, grapefruit
Remarkable People Eau de Parfum,Etat Libre d'Orange," What are the markings of a remarkable person? Perhaps characteristics like vibrant energy, an ability to get things done, with grace, and a magnetism that draws others like honey. Etat Libre D'Orange, known for their unusual offerings, takes on the challenge of creating the olfactive aura of charisma.The result is utterly celebratory, fizzing like an assertive flute of champagne. Bright, tart grapefruit bubbles at the surface, melding with cardamom to be beautifully spicy without veering too piquant. The jasmine peeks through smoothly, not heady or heavy, but mellow, staying low with light hints of labdanum, creating a wonderful illusion of warmed skin in the sun. For a creamy sandalwood drydown, the woods remain warm and lightly sweet, with a sophisticated fruity sheen sustained from the grapefruit and cardamom.  This is a triumphant creation that sparkles on the skin; Remarkable People is both extraordinary and electrifying."," Grapefruit, champagne accord, cardamom, jasmine, curry JE, black pepper, labdanum, sandalwood, lorenox",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/47749.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, grapefruit
Bull's Blood Eau de Parfum,Imaginary Authors,"A man who has killed is a man who knows passion.-Devante ValÃ©reoDevante ValÃ©reo was raised in a dusty Spanish village on the Balearic Sea. He fondly recalled going to the bullfights with his father,  an ex-picador,  and credited those early experiences with inspiring his most popular novella,  Bull's Blood. The book's lurid tale of seduction garnered obscenity charges against the author. Though the charges were rejected by the court,  a ban on the sale of his works persisted for a number of years.A fixture in Barcelona,  smoking cigarillos and writing in the cafÃ©s and bars into the night,  ValÃ©reo disappeared as a fugitive in 1967 after a highly publicized bar scuffle with American sailors,  one of whom later died from his injuries.A man who has killed,  he wrote in Bull's Blood, is a man who knows passion. No exaggeration here,  this is a highly animalic scent not for the faint of heart."," Patchouli, rose, costus root, tobacco, black musk, bull's blood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77501.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, patchouli
Falling Into The Sea Eau de Parfum,Imaginary Authors,"Caught in the undertow of his salty lemon lips I caught myself drifting helplessly into a soundless summer unconsciousness.-Nica GalaAt the age of nineteen Nica Galas published her first book, the autobiographical tome Falling into the Sea which chronicled her short and torrid love affair among the hot beaches and lemon trees in the Gulf of Naples. The breathtaking story opens with Nica and her girlfriends picking bunches of jasmine flower for boys while they cliff-jumped into the sea. An innocent first kiss erupts into an ardent summer entanglement which is cut short one moonlit night when her lover leaps into the dark abyss never to surface, leaving Nica naked on the cliffs screaming his name. Falling into the Sea is is sunshine in a bottle, perfect on cloudy days to invoke the ardor of summer."," Lemon, bergamot, grapefruit, lychee, tropical flowers, warm sand",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77504.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, lemon
The Cobra & The Canary Eau de Parfum,Imaginary Authors,"We were driving faster than dammit, headed due west for a place called Anywhere But Here.-James SpundtWhen a tip from a clairvoyant leads 23-year old Neal Orris to a rural Connecticut barn housing his deceased father's secret obsession, a pristine 1964 Shelby Cobra Roadster, it is the getaway ticket he was desperately searching for. After liberating his best friend Ike from his dead-end job on the family farm, the two hit the open highway. Aiming for the Palm Springs race tracks, their journey is a blur of seedy motels, cool swimming pools, hot debutantes, cocktails, and cigarette smoke. Each stop finds the friends inventing new pseudonyms and personas for themselves, their innocent game hurtling into the depths of decadence and desolation. Like smoking a spicy cigar on an aged leather seat, driving with the windows down and smelling the summer heat rise from asphalt. It's the simple luxuries in life..."," Lemon, orris, tobacco flowers, leather, hay fields, asphalt",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77508.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, lemon
Altruist Eau de Parfum,J.F. Schwarzlose," This is the new Eau de Parfum version of Altruist, originally released in 2016 as a collaboration between J.F. Schwarzlose and the Berlin artist Paul deFlorian. The result of a series of intense conversations between perfumer VÃ©ronique Nyberg and deFlorian, every note in Altruist represents a color or brushstroke from one of deFlorian's paintings. It is an unusual concept for a perfume, but one that works so beautifully it's been shortlisted for the Independent Perfume category in the Art and Olfaction Awards 2017. Altruist opens with fresh, sparkling notes of bergamot, lemon, and ginger representing the swirls of light green and aquamarine colors on the painting, while the warmer slashes of red and orange on the canvas are translated via the explosive heat of cracked black pepper and nutmeg. The almost sterilefroideur of the man's sightless gaze in the painting is portrayed through use of a special MANE captive molecule called Aqual, which gives the scent a cold, crystalline shimmer, like sunlight on a diamond. For the new EDP version, the perfumer and artist decided to add Ambrarome, a material that gives the perfume a dense, dry woodiness with an undertone of something moist and bitter, creating the delightful effect of paper dipped in Japanese calligraphy ink. DeFlorian himself calls Altruist ascent for feminists, cyborgs and survivors, and in our opinion, it is the perfect summer fragrance for those who like a balance between the sappy freshness of citrus and the tinder-dry crackle of woods and spice."," bergamot, lemon, ginger, watery notes, rose, orange blossom, nutmeg, black pepper, cedar, vetiver, patchouli, ambrarome",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76900.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Vanille Blackberry,Comptoir Sud Pacifique," A heavenly exercise by Comptoir Sud Pacifique, exploring the possibilities for a fragrance both fresh and velvety-soft. Vanille Blackberry sings brightly from the start, opening playfully tart with a burst of fizzing lemon and bergamot. Then, the lovely cloud of floral fruit takes over, with rose and jasmine in attendance, but never too heady, just light and pretty. But in the billowing cloud, the stars of the show are blackberry and vanilla, forming a sweet, velvety-soft melange. The blackberry creates a perfect, lightly piquant contrast to the swoon-worthy classic Comptoir Sud Pacifique vanilla. Like a tea-time delicacy, this soft, floral-fruity vanilla just gets smoother in the drydown, light and delicate, enveloped in white musk and cashmere woods. Luscious, fluffy, yet glowing - a must for any vanilla lover."," Lemon, bergamot, rose, jasmine, blackberry, pink berries, musk, vanilla, cashmere wood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/23814.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, lemon
Une Tonne de Roses Eau de Parfum,Parle Moi de Parfum," So called because it takes 3.5 tons of rose petals to make just one kilo of rose essence, Une Tonne de Roses has a natural delicacy that belies its hefty name. It opens with a fresh, soft pink rose glistening with the wet sparkle of fruit  green apple or an Asian pear, perhaps. There is also, briefly, a hint of something winey and truffled playing around the edges of the rose, but it never commits to darkness. This is an innocent little rosebud of a rose, just about to burst into being.We start out in Spring, with a dewy rose, but we end up in Fall, with a clean, earthy patchouli. Although more a watercolor than the gouache of Almairac's earlier masterpiece, Voleur de Roses, Une Tonne de Roses completes a similar journey, fading from the pale pink blush of the rose to the golden brown leaf mulch of patchouli. Finishing in a clean, crystalline musk, Une Tonne de Roses strikes us as a Japanese screen version of the ever-popular rose and patchouli combination  delicate, crisp, and achingly pretty."," Rose, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76700.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, rose
Milky Musk Eau de Parfum,Parle Moi de Parfum," In the late 1990's and under the direction of Tom Ford, Michel Almairac created one of the most iconic perfumes of the 20th century: Gucci Rush. A massive lactonic peach with a voice like a foghorn, it wore like the tightest, shiniest red vinyl dress ever created. Now twenty years later, Michel picks up the reins again to create a softer, muskier version that explores the same theme of milk and fruit, but this time with an indoors voice. Milky Musk first melts a leafy-green, coconutty fig down into a pool of warm, creamy sandalwood and wraps it all in a cloudy, milky musk that feels like cashmere. Soft and vaporous, it shifts around the body like a second skin as the wearer moves. Over time, the musk parts to reveal the bitterness of fruit skin, giving the creamy lactones an adult bite. Imagine a slimmed-down Rush, grown soft and husky with age, and you're in the right ballpark. It's adorable."," Sandalwood, musk, fig",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76705.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, sandalwood
Tomboy Neroli Eau de Parfum,Parle Moi de Parfum," Tomboy Neroli is a paradox: sexy and clean. It smells like a freshly-laundered cotton t-shirt stripped off a hot, young body that has been wearing a classic eau de cologne all day. Male or female? Doesn't matter. When it's this good, it's for everyone.  The crisp greenness of neroli up top is as refreshing as drenching oneself in eau de cologne straight from the fridge on a hot day. As it melts into the waxy orange blossom notes underneath, the neroli loses its freshness and becomes subsumed by the honeyed warmth of the white floral. All of this draped over a smoky woody amber that gives you the chemical high of a good white musk. The equivalent of the perfect white t-shirt, this one's for sexy tomboys everywhere."," Neroli, orange blossom, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76706.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, neroli
Satori Eau de Parfum,Parfum Satori," For her house's signature scent,  Satori Osawa needed the perfect fusion of French and Japanese materials,  techniques,  and aesthetics,  and yet her inspiration came from a precious ingredient derived from somewhere else entirely- Middle Eastern agarwood,  or oud. And yet,  the choice is perfect,  as agarwood exemplifies the Japanese concept of ""five tastes, "" exhibiting spicy,  bitter,  sweet,  sour and salty facets all at once. A fragrance that fully encapsulates all five of these elements,  Satori features a carefully selected suite of notes meant to complement each,  with cinnamon and clove enhancing the spicy,  cacao the bitter,  vanilla the sweet,  and bitter orange,  oak moss and cypress for the sour and salty. Blended over a smooth,  woody bed of sandalwood and frankincense,  eastern and western elements converge with sublime balance,  creating a gentle,  warm and enveloping atmosphere. In this way,  Satori is ultimately a fragrance that is universal but delightfully specific,  where Japanese concepts become a global philosophy- elegant,  romantic and enchanting."," Bergamot, coriander, cinnamon, clove, cacao, vanilla, frankincense, sandalwood, oak moss, agarwood (oud)",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76800.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Iris Homme Eau de Parfum,Parfum Satori," The traditional arts of Japan are permeated with a dedication to simplicity- the idea that the more diligently and deliberately a flower is placed, or a brushstroke applied, the more significant it becomes. As a guiding principle for perfumery, it represents a departure from the operatic construction of European classics, and it is this principle that makes Iris Homme a deeply distinguished masculine of powerful subtlety. Iris Homme opens with bright, clarifying citrus, an authentically juicy lemon given masculine contrast with an undercurrent of spicy cardamom that leads into the dry floral heart. The iris in question recalls MPG's classic Iris Bleu Gris in its clean, robust take on the note, but here the naturalism is slightly more incorporated, as an earthy violet and jasmine combination lingers softly but noticeably in the background. A warmly accessible base of ambered sandalwood provides appropriately simple and long-lasting character, making this an ideal fragrance for situations formal and informal alike. Simplicity, after all, leaves ample room for interpretation."," Lemon, cardamom, orange flower, iris, violet, jasmine, amber, sandalwood, light musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76801.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, lemon
Wasanbon Eau de Parfum,Parfum Satori," Wasanbon is an intricate puzzle veiled in beguiling charm. Evoking Japanese tea-time, Wasanbon is a type of fine Japanese sugar hand-purified in multiple stages, used to make the highest class of delicate sugar candy. Perfumer Satori Osawa was tickled by its homonym in French,Wa sent bon meaningWa smells good  Wa being the Japanese word for social harmony. Unlike the typical scent imagined from the concept of Wa, Wasanbon is mischievous, gliding into any situation with its sparkling confectionary charm, but slowly revealing the elegant, refined heart within. A tart, tangy lemon opens the fragrance, immediately uplifting, giddy on clouds. Not only is it sprinkled with crystalline sugar, but rounded out with juicy muscat grape, tart and sweet. These immediate fruits give way to a most delicate, pillowy mÃ©lange of lightly honeyed mimosa flower, lily-of-the-valley, and the body of the fragrance, an exquisite wasanbon sugar, finely purified and crushed, sieved into the finest powder. A dusting of almond and vanilla only add to the heavenly delight of the senses. As the candy dissolves away, Wasanbon remains light and airy, lifted with an exquisite iris and soft, velvety guaiacwood. What could be more charming?"," Lemon, muscat, mimosa, muguet, almond, sugar, honey, vanilla, iris, guaiacwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76803.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, lemon
Io Non Ho Mani Che Mi Accarezzino il Volto Extrait de Parfum,UNUM," Io Non Ho Mani Che Mi Accarezzino il Volto - ""There are no hands / to caress my face."" This is the beginning of a 1948 poem by Father David Maria Turoldo, which the Italian photographer Mario Giacomelli took as the name for a photography series in the early 1960s. It's these photos that serve as the inspiration for UNUM's founder and artist Filippo Sorcinelli's new fragrance. The photos are striking: disarming images of young priests in states of joyous movement, dancing and playing. The fragrance is an olfactory rendering of the stunning imagery, capturing the humanity beneath the black cassocks.  The fragrance opens with a fizzy glow of crackling petitgrain and bergamot, which lifts up to reveal the heart: a breathtaking wall of scent, flawlessly blended cedar with spice, like cinnamon, and clary sage, ylang ylang, and resins. The drydown evokes what we imagine the seminary could have been, its stone walled building resonating with sandalwood, rituals cloaked in incense and benzoin, and the warm puff of tobacco. It transports you into Giacomelli's photographs of the clergymen smoking cigars - when the rector saw these images, it was the last straw, and Giacomelli was prevented from ever photographing at the seminary again."," Petitgrain, bergamot, galbanum, myrrh, cedar, geranium, clary sage, cinnamon, styrax, ylang-ylang, incense, benzoin, tonka bean, tobacco, amber, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/71906.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, petitgrain
Brooklyn Eau de Parfum,Gallivant," The beating creative heart of the East Coast, Brooklyn is a borough crackling with excitement and youthful joy. Power walking to a breakfast meeting over the Brooklyn Bridge. Life on the sidewalk, early summer breezes, the glow from the lighting in bars and diners, bright apartments stuffed with books. Cocktails with friends. A lazy May afternoon in the sun at Park Slope, warmth on the skin. Small flowers in the grass. Fresh air. These are the scents reflected in Brooklyn, a musky citrus tinged with crackling spice and the deep ozone of life in the midst of one of the world's busiest cities. Energetic with a creative and intellectual fizz, Brooklyn will have you feeling like you're in the very center of the cultural universe."," Bergamot, squeezed lemon, orange juice, incense, cardamom, fresh air, ozonic notes, magnolia, orris root, transparent flowers, musks, white woods, benzoin, amber.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76600.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Istanbul Eau de Parfum,Gallivant," Istanbul- an ancient city teeming with freshness and modernity. Old luxury meeting new confidence. The exact spot where two continents, and two cultures, meet, with every result you could imagine. With Istanbul, Gallivant celebrates this thrilling, august, contradictory city in all its complication and glory, delivering a rich, ostensibly masculine scent that would also wear stunningly sexy on any woman, rich in creamy coffee, suede leather, incense and exotic spice, sweet and rich, yet subtly powdery and nimble, dignified but far from stolid. Waking up in Moda, crossing the Bosphorus for a balmy night in KarakÃ¶y- a fragrance as dynamic and intriguing as Istanbul itself."," Bergamot, cardamom, red thyme, lavender absolute, egyptian geranium essence, patchouli heart, sweet myrrh, sandalwood, vanilla, tonka bean, amber, musks",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76601.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Arcana Rosa Eau de Parfum,L'Artisan Parfumeur," There's no shortage of pithy phrases involving roses and thorns, but you'd never know it by smelling the bland softness of most mass market rose fragrances. Luckily, Arcana Rosa's thorns are front and center, hardened over an open cedar fire and spiked with rooty vetiver and prickly cade. Through the smoke, a lush, beautifully full bodied Bulgarian rose still asserts its beauty, but the woods and resins transmute its strength into something of awe and danger, a rose equally at home on a man or woman. We're not surprised that the Natura Fabularis collection needed a rose. We're simply grateful that they decided that they decided that the same old rose just wouldn't do.Each Natura Fabularis fragrance is presented in an exquisite glass atomizer flacon with a beautiful metal bee detail."," Rose, cedarwood, sandalwood, vetiver, cade, labdanum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/152016.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, rose
Tenebrae Eau de Parfum,L'Artisan Parfumeur," Tenebrae, as the official text from the Natura Fabularis collection describes it, is the scent of a ""dark and shadowy forest"" so overgrown that light barely peeks through the treetops, and we certainly wouldn't disagree. But in true fairy tale fashion, this forest hides not only mysterious dangers, represented with dark resins and woods, but also mystical wonders, in the form of a marvelously sweet and complex crystallized sap note that combines with a not-too-heavy dose of incense. The result is a fragrance that lifts us upwards, letting us know that the sun is still there, even if we can't quite see it.Each Natura Fabularis fragrance is presented in an exquisite glass atomizer flacon with a beautiful metal bee detail."," Incense, resin, sap",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/152017.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, incense
Nisean Eau de Parfum,Parfums de Marly," Powerful, elegant and confidently exotic, Nisean is a masculine oriental with refinement to spare. Named for a legendary breed of ancient Persian horse, Nisean features an effortless balance of smoky, spicy, and woodsy notes, for a stylish and striking gentleman who knows how to leave a lasting impression.Nisean opens with a rich burst of resinous florals and sweet woods balanced with a rich vein of saffron, imbuing a familiar set of notes with uncommonly refined quality. As the deep, earthy patchouli emerges to balance the sweetness, an airy incense-like quality emanates forth, keeping everything balanced with surprising agility. Yes, you've smelled a masculine oriental before. But Nisean, with its power, dignity and subtlety, towers above its competitors."," Saffron, labdanum, flowers, patchouli, precious woods",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70022.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, saffron
Musc Gold Perfume Oil,Bruno Acampora," In an era where modern fragrance can feel cold, distant and minimalist, Bruno Acampora presents us with bold, baroque beauty. Musc Gold is an homage to the house's most undeniable classic, a warm, sensual, complex musk scent that captures the high-art-meets-casual-cool sensibility of Southern Italy. In this gorgeous new version, the original earthy smoothness of Acampora's original is preserved, but supplemented with a contemporary, slightly bitter twist of lavender, injecting both energy and a subtle masculinity. Don't worry- women and men alike can- and should- wear this on any and every occasion."," Musk, honeyed florals, neroli, rose, jasmine, violet, vanilla, amber, lavender, patchouli, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/37537.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, musk

Cypress Shade Eau de Parfum,The House Of Oud," More shade than cypress, Cypress Shade is so astonishingly good at capturing the cool, herbal dampness of the ground under a cypress tree that you might want to curl up and take a little nap. Take a good book with you, and a glass of ice-cold Pastis.The mastic woodiness of the cypress does not dominate, forming instead a softly green, balsamic curtain through which the other notes shine. Fresh mint, vetiver, and coriander form a cooling mat of aromatic grasses that is as welcome on a hot day as a cool cloth on the forehead. The unmistakable licorice snap of anise darts and weaves through the damp green notes, turning the mind most pleasurably to the midday aperitif. But what elevates this scent beyond the standard woody aromatic is the mimosa, a powdery yellow flower that smells like almond flour, glue, cucumber, and innocence itself. The mimosa sparkles before folding itself into a vigorous base of Madagascaran cedar and Haitian vetiver. It ends, as all things should, in the milky, anise-tinted blur of Pastis."," Lemon, bergamot, badiane, mandarin, petitgrain, mimosa, coriander, mint, cedar, vetiver, oud",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76404.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, lemon
Almond Harmony Eau de Parfum,The House Of Oud," Inspired by the early blossoms of the almond tree, which signify resurrection and the dawning of life, Almond Harmony is a beautifully constructed floral oriental that ignites the senses and invigorates the spirit. Opening with a joyous burst of sweet, fresh almond supported by creamy orange blossom, Almond Harmony seamlessly layers on a gorgeous floral bouquet in the heart, weaving the sweetness of ylang and the distinctly almond tones of heliotrope with smooth jasmine and powdery iris. In the deep, balsamic base, gentle touches of oud and musk introduce a hint of sensuality, while never compromising the fresh, genuine spirit of the scent. Optimistic, vibrant and downright lovely, Almond Harmony is an unexpected  pleasure."," Orange blossom, almond, iris, jasmine, heliotrope, ylang-ylang, tolu balsam, tonka bean, musk, vanilla, peru balsam, Burma oud",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76400.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, orange blossom
Riviere Extrait de Parfum,Thameen," In the world of fine jewelry, a RiviÃ¨re is a classic necklace comprised of seamlessly graduated gemstones, such as the stunning and oft-photographed set of old cut diamonds famously passed down from Queen Mary to Princess Margaret. To translate this timeless and elegant design to the world of fragrance, Thameen has constructed a shimmering, balanced scent that showcases a flawless progression of rare and sparkling ingredients combined to adorn the skin. Riviere opens with an arresting sparkle, showcasing spicy notes of Indian black pepper and Persian saffron that melt into rich cinnamon and luminously warm lemon blossom. Behind the dazzle, a rich and sophisticated heart of clary sage over lush rose and carnation balance atop a warm, gently earthy patchouli. An iridescent base of golden amber and smooth oud layered atop glowing leather give the scent resinous heat and elegant, mysterious brilliance. With each exceptional ingredient leading seamlessly into the next, Riviere is a masterclass in fragrance construction, a scent that fits together so perfectly that its true sophistication must be experienced to be understood."," Black pepper, cinnamon, saffron, lemon blossom, clary sage, carnation, rose, patchouli, oud, leather, cypriol, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/73413.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, black pepper

Aqua Celestia Eau de Toilette,Maison Francis Kurkdjian," While his beloved creations now span across every conceivable fragrance family, from gourmand orientals to dark, modern florals, we'll always think of Francis Kurkdjian first and foremost as the creator of impossibly lovely, ultra-fresh musks that you'd wish your entire life could smell like. And with Aqua Celestia, the master gives us another all-encompassing musk obsession, a rich yet delicate blend of air and sea freshness, spiked with lime and cool mint, caressed by tart, juicy blackcurrant, softened with deliciously full mimosa blossoms from ProvenÃ§e. Plenty of fragrances advertise themselves as versatile, but you genuinely can't go wrong here- spray it over jeans and a t-shirt for a casually sexy burst of style, marvel at how intimate and confident it presents with formalwear, or even spritz it over your sheets for a truly lovely slumber. Francis Kurkdjian will doubtlessly continue to innovate and push boundaries as his legend grows ever larger, but between us, we hope he never abandons lovely, perfectly fresh scents like Aqua Celestia."," Lime, cool mint mitcham, blackcurrant bud absolute, mimosa absolute, musk accord",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/49871.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, lime
Nightingale Extrait de Parfum,Zoologist," If the thickest fuchsia silk could be encapsulated in perfume, it would smell like Nightingale, Zoologist's floral chypre. A startlingly beautiful Japanese plum blossom top note is supported by a deeply lush rose and fresh green violet. Balanced by spritely citrus and woody notes, Nightingale soars between airy and opulent.As Nightingale trills her eloquent flowery song, nighttime fragrances of incense and light oud permeate the composition, lending a mysterious, twilight quality. In the dry down, oakmoss and patchouli brings the scents of ancient trees and damp earth as Nightingale's serenade quiets.  Sensual, rich and serenely lovely, Nightingale is a rare bird."," Bergamot, lemon, saffron, Japanese plum blossom, rose, violet, oud, patchouli, sandalwood, moss, frankincense, white musk, labdanum, ambergris",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76004.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Civet Extrait de Parfum,Zoologist," An homage to the ingredient that gave that deliciously naughty, animalic note to the great elegant perfumes of the 30s and 40s, such as Rochas Femme and Schiaparelli Shocking, Civet is a gorgeous retro-style chypre. Civet's zingy opening makes her seem like a modern gal, thanks to a vigorous citrus-pepper top note and herbal bite. Then, a plethora of heady floral notes swan in: heliotrope, linden, and hyacinth, creating a perfume of almost unbearable loveliness.Civet could have stopped right there and remained breathtakingly pretty. But she has darker motives and starts to undress, revealing her voluptuousness with fleshy ylang ylang and tuberose. That animalic touch of those yesteryear beauties is there as you would expect, and gives Civet its low growl. But a slow-blooming, deep red carnation lends Civet its vintage charm. The spicy flower opens up in the middle stages, revealing a classically pretty bloom, creamy with hints of clove and green stem. When it finally stretches out on a gourmand bed of coffee, vanilla and incense, Civet purrs like a contented kitten."," Bergamot, black pepper, lemon, orange, spices, tarragon, carnation, frangipani, heliotrope, hyacinth, linden blossom, tuberose, ylang, balsams, civet, coffee, incense, labdanum, musks, oakmoss, resins, Russian leather, vanilla, vetiver, woods",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Oud Wood Body Spray Scented Body Spray,TOM FORD Private Blend," Now, enjoy Tom Ford's most iconic fragrances in an invigorating body spray, delicately scented and perfect for everyday wear. Oud Wood contains a powerful blend of cool spices and smoky woods, softened with a hint of vanilla and tonka bean. The daunting, medicinal and overly animalic facets of oud are toned down, translating the precious agarwood into a darkly elegant element of the perfumer's palette rather than a full-on French-Arabian extravaganza."," Oud, Chinese pepper, pink pepper, cardamom, birch tar, cistus, incense, sandalwood, vetiver, patchouli, cedarwood Atlas, vanilla, tonka bean Click Here For Ingredients ÃClose Oud Wood Body Spray by TOM FORD Private Blend Ingredients Please be aware that ingredient lists may change or vary from time to time.

Kismet Eau de Parfum,Lubin," ""Folly!"" That's how the elderly owner of the Lubin Perfume House, Monsieur Paul Prot, described the elephant-shaped perfume bottle that had appeared on his desk. It had been designed for a princess.  Spiritual and multilingual, Kismet cultivated the mystery surrounding her background. She reigned over the Parisian parties of the Roaring Twenties for a time, then one day slipped away, never to be seen again. All that remained was the memory of the scent that Lubin had created for her.And what a scent it is- lush and heady, sweet and intoxicating, wedding the vivacious freshness of bergamot, lemon and nose-tingling petitgrain to a velvety menagerie of exquisite types of rose, all set against smooth, creamy vanilla and sumptuously sensual patchouli and myrrh. Like the now faded-to-legend princess, this Kismet is at once seductive and delightful, exotic and familiar, and altogether ravishing. Another touch of vintage elegance from the house of Lubin."," Bergamot, lemon, petitgrain, Rose Centifolia, Bulgarian rose, patchouli, labdanum cistus, opoponax, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/31226.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Bass Solo Eau de Parfum,The Vagabond Prince," Inspired by Wendge, the beautifully dark-grained African wood whose dense timber makes it coveted for the crafting of musical instruments, Bass Solo, the newest scent from The Vagabond Prince, is truly a virtuosic work. While Wenge doesn't have an aroma of its own, its combination of beauty and function inspired master perfumer Bertrand Duchaufour to fashion a fragrance that itself extracts deep and vibrant accords hidden within its notes. Like the profound resonance of the titular instrument, Bass Solo offers an aroma pitched in the lowest register, its dense melody composed of a selection of exquisite woody notes including soft sandalwood, salty driftwood, and a blend of cedars with warm, comfortable, dry nuances. Smoky tar and velvety peach flow through the striations, while a light floral cardamom combines with the woodsy warmth to softly caress the wearer. Meanwhile a higher pich of lavender represents the cold metal of the strings, bringing spice and wood together to create magic. Sleek yet deep, beautiful yet powerful, Bass Solo represents a bold new evolution for The Vagabond Prince, and is as striking a scent as we've encountered all year."," Saffron, ginger, lime, cardamom, lavender, Moroccan cedar, Virginia cedar, fig milk, birch tar, sandalwood, amber, driftwood, wenge accord, musk, oppoponax, amyris, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/60003.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, saffron
Au Dela Narcisse Eau de Parfum,Bruno Fazzolari," When we released the original Au DelÃ ,  we praised it as a ""big,  ravishingly spicy floral with a knockout drydown, "" the kind of throwback chypre that proved not only that Bruno Fazzolari had the chops to take on a titan of the classical French perfume style,  but to make it his own with a uniquely lively,  American aplomb. With Au DelÃ  Narcisse,  Fazzolari takes his old-school chypre- made with genuine oakmoss and labdanum- and adds a stunning dose of rare,  exquisite narcissus that is clear,  fresh,  and unmistakable. Atop a classic base,  richly spicy and resinous with just the right amount of animalistic purr,  Au DelÃ  Narcisse feels vintage and classic in all the right ways- but fresh,  modern and exciting in many others. One thing we know for sure: this is Bruno Fazzolari's best work yet."," Bergamot, narcissus, jasmine, oakmoss, orange blossom, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/69307.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
I Feel Love Eau de Parfum,Cinnamon Projects," In this time of societal division, Cinnamon Projects delivers a fragrance that explores the unifying power of love. I Feel Love is inspired by the euphoria of emotional connection, boundless expression and collective energy. Titled after the pivotal collaboration of Giorgio Moroder and Donna Summer and composed of undeniably sensual notes including amber, iris and myrrh, I Feel Love is a wearable reminder of the political, artistic and sexual freedoms we may only achieve together.This limited edition Eau de Parfum version of I Feel Love comes in a travel-friendly 9ml spray bottle."," Amber, iris, leather, myrrh, oud",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/72513.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, amber
Plein Jeu III-V Extrait de Parfum,Filippo Sorcinelli - SAUF," Plein Jeu III-V opens with a soft lemon and ginger pairing that lends an aromatic lightness to the oily black pepper and cold, green frankincense. A wreath of fresh white jasmine and powdery, fluffy mimosa forms a frothy halo around the darker myrrh and balsam notes, lifting the accords into the air like notes of music. Filippo says that this scent was inspired by an endless dance of angels, and we can see that. It is as airborne as a curl of white smoke in a dark space."," Lemon, ginger, mimosa, black pepper, amber, olibanum, jasmine, cedar, balsam fir, myrrh, oakmoss, patchouli, sandalwood, vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/75801.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, lemon
Voix Humaine 8 Extrait de Parfum,Filippo Sorcinelli - SAUF," Voix Humaine 8 is inspired by Vox Humana, a type of reed stop on the organ designed to impressionistically imitate the human voice. When pressed, this stop has the tone of a soprano hitting a high note, a sound that seems to linger in the air long after the other notes fade. Accordingly, Voix Humaine 8 takes dry, peppery incense and infuses it with a cool, white floral milk, giving it the sweet edge of a singed marshmallow. Musky ambrette seed and a mousseline accord lend the texture a cashmere softness that tempers the dark incense. If you take your incense with a dash of cream and sugar, then make this a priority."," Bergamot, cardamom, elemi, ambrette, jasmine, orange blossom, amber, leather, olibanum, milk mousse, musk, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/75802.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Debaser Pocket Perfume Perfume Oil,D.S. and Durga," Blaring Pixies music on a hot day - that's the inspiration for D.S. and Duga's woody fig scent, Debaser. For anyone who has heard Pixies' front man Black Francis' wail, the thought of a fig scent may seem an odd choice. But Debaser, named after the bands 1989 hit, is not a typically creamy, lactic or fruity fig. It's a bright, hot green scent that opens with a waft of fig tree broiling in the August sun. It's an energetic, warm, bold and woody fig. It's a fragrance that becomes even more compelling in its drydown, when it shed the specificity of its figgy verisimilitude. That's when a perfect blend of base notes - iris, coconut, tonka and moss -  leave cool, velvet-soft hint of wood on skin. Earthy and addictive.This Pocket Perfume is a 10ml perfume oil roll-on ideal for travel or daily carry."," Bergamot, green leaf, pear stem, fig, coconut milk, iris, blond woods, tonka bean, moss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/68624.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Arbole Eau de Parfum,Hiram Green Perfumes," In Federico GarcÃ­a Lorca's famous poem, ArbolÃ©, ArbolÃ©..., a succession of travelers unsuccessfully attempt to sway the affections of a pretty young woman picking olives from a green tree. Just like its namesake poem, Hiram Green's ArbolÃ© is simple and beautiful, deeply evocative and quietly, sumptuously romantic. Based on a deceptively short list of notes, it nonetheless exudes hidden complexity, as earthy, naturalistic patchouli merges with dry, robust cedar and velvety sandalwood to create overlapping tonalities of sweet and smooth, and soft and spicy, that exude the beguiling yet straightforward beauty of Lorca's heroine. As it dries, creamy vanilla and powdery tonka whisk us further into the magically-real dream, where none of the many colorful opportunities that beckon us away from our dry, green tree could be as fulfilling as the life in front of our eyes."," Patchouli, cedar, sandalwood, vanilla, tonka bean",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/68104.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, patchouli
Sheiduna Parfum Extrait,Puredistance," Shei-du-na. Enunciate each syllable and all the right associations come to mind: she, sheikh, dunes. In his 1992 novel The English Patient, Michael Ondaatje mentions that sand dunes in the Sahara resemble the dips and hollows of a woman's back. Sheiduna perfectly captures that sense of duality between two things that look the same and yet are not the same  the shadowed softness of a woman's hip and the dusty angularity of a wind-sharpened dune. The opening is a plume of smoke and tangerine peel set inside a golden, radiant cloud of resins that swirls around the wearer like a sand storm. Out of this expansive blur of sparkling particles emerges a spicy clove note that gives the fragrance a subtle vintage Opium hue. A rich rose weaves in and out of this fuzzy haze of amber and spices, like the orange-red glow of lighthouse in thick fog. It's this seamless shifting between dry, spicy radiance and soft, sweet florals and vanilla that makes Sheiduna so interesting  and so difficult to define. We'd sum it up by saying it's like breathing in the arid air of the desert while nuzzling the neck of an exotically perfumed woman."," Lemon, tangerine, blackcurrant, aldehydes, Bulgarian rose essence, geranium, clove, vetiver, patchouly, woody amber, incense, benzoin, myrrh, tonka bean, vanilla pods, musks",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/53010.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, lemon
Covent Garden Eau de Parfum,Jack Perfume," Covent Garden- an iconic section of central London, known for historic theatre and opera venues, classic architecture, and the fruit and vegetable market made world famous in My Fair Lady. It's a district of bustle and commerce, high culture and history, and Richard E. Grant sets out to capture it all in Covent Garden the fragrance, an exuberant and sparkling unisex citrus floral rich with the smells and energy of one of London's most vibrant locales. Covent Garden opens with crisp, buzzing notes of orange, lime and ginger, an energized portrait of a market in full swing. As distinctive florals and spices emerge in the heart, the tableau pans backwards, revealing the elegance that frames the action. Finally, striking and unique notes of carrot and buttery orris radiate sophistication and depth, connecting the ancient to the modern and every dynamic era in between. Jack Perfume's fragrances truly are love letters to London, and with Covent Garden, the full, delightful spectrum of what there is to love in this spectacular city is on full display."," Orange, lime, ginger, pink peppercorns, rose, pimento, carrot, orris, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/75601.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, orange
Picadilly '69 Eau de Parfum,Jack Perfume," On his first-ever trip to London in 1969, a 12-year old Richard E. Grant was mesmerized by the colorful characters of Picadilly Circus- not to mention the intoxicating scents of the busy social hub- the petrol, the leather, the Earl Grey tea, and of course, the patchouli oil worn so ubiquitously by mods, hippies and youth of all stripes. Picadilly '69 is a faithful ode to this scent memory, a visceral rush of spicy, earthy, stimulating and narcotic, a perfect representation of the extremely specific time and place, but also the universal experience of a teenager taking their first hesitant steps into the desires and appeals of the adult world. Picadilly '69 opens crisp and fresh, with bergamot (representing the Earl Grey at Fortnum and Mason) and ginger giving an invigorating initial rush against the green notes wafting over from nearby St. James' Park. The energetic cityscape is well-represented in the heart,  with hypnotic notes of cypriol and petrol, while the rich leather drydown is sensuous and provocative. Whether you fondly remember the Summer of Love, or merely want a taste of a historic, yet personal, awakening, Picadilly '69 will take you to a time and place where anything was possible."," Bergamot, ginger, green leaves, cypriol, mate, petrol, cedar, amber, leather",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/75602.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Jack Eau de Parfum,Jack Perfume," Richard E. Grant has long been a star of stage and screen, bringing life to dynamic characters in revered films and shows including Downton Abbey, Withnail & I, and Doctor Who. But his lifelong obsession has never been the dramatic, but rather, the olfactory. And we're delighted to report that his flagship scent, Jack Eau de Parfum, is no mere celebuscent, but rather, a revelation-  an addictive combination of earthy and citrus notes that's as striking and attention-getting as it is deeply, hypnotically enjoyable. Opening with a distinct and edgy burst of tart lime and herbaceous marijuana, a spicy bouquet in the heart quickly delivers on Jack EDP's promise to deliver ""a hypnotic fragrance to be savoured by both men and women."" Rich woods, tobacco, incense and musk assert themselves powerfully but casually, making Jack a perfect everyday fragrance, as at home over jeans and a t-shirt as it would be striking with formalwear. Distinct, provocative, comfortable, and quintessentially British, Jack is an example of that wondrous and all-too-rare scent that just plain smells great."," Lime, mandarin, clove, pepper, nutmeg, oud, vetiver, white musk, marijuana accord, tobacco absolute, olibanum resin",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/75600.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, lime
Eau Sacree Extrait de Parfum,HEELEY," Since ancient days, disparate societies separated by thousands of miles and thousands of years have all nevertheless used incense as a centerpiece of their spiritual practices, and it's certainly no mystery why- with its delicate, ethereal nature, incense seems like a crucial connection point between our world and a higher plane of existence where the tangible and the metaphysical intertwine. With Eau SacrÃ©e, James Heeley invites us through that veil, into a world of soft but intensely powerful smokes and resins meant to purify the soul, free the mind from earthly matters and lift the spirit to a higher state of being. Eau SacrÃ©e is a potent, yet understated fragrance that expertly combines resinous labdanum, subtle spice, and warm, sweet myrhh around a divine and exquisite olibanum incense both soft and rich, smoky and transparent, and utterly exceptional. Glowing with serenity and enlightenment, Eau SacrÃ©e is an incense scent with higher purpose, which simply must be experienced to be understood."," Aldehydes, clove, nutmeg, pepper, incense, amber, cedar, musk, opoponax, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/31525.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, aldehydes
Cuir Andalou Eau de Parfum,Rania J.," Andalusia, the romantic southern tip of Spain, where Europe meets Africa. A region known for its ancient walled cities, Moorish arches, and famous leather workshops tucked away on dusty, cobblestone streets. Like the eclectic, vibrant region for which it is named, Cuir Andalou is balanced to perfection. Its warm, rich leather mingles with the cool darkness of oud. Smoke and dusty saffron waft through a floral heart of neroli, rose, violet and iris. Vetiver and castoreum leave a powdery, earthy dry-down. This is one of the most potent, interesting, and surprising leathers we've come across in a long time. We can't stop sniffing."," Leather, Patchouli, Saffron, Neroli, rose, Violet, iris, Castoreum, Vetiver, Sandalwood & Oud",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/751006.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, leather
1976 Eau de Parfum,Floris London," 1976 Eau de Parfum is a fragrance of juxtaposition in an era of light and shade. A fragrance of youth, where light and energy were born from a period of change in the late 20th century. A positive outlook from a generation claiming London for their own. Fashion, art, music and culture created a hub of style.An aromatic woody scent with black pepper, juniper berry and lavender, freshened by green bergamot and Sicilian lemon. An undertone of amber, patchouli, and musk add a sensual warmth and dark edge."," Bergamot, lemon, birch leaf, black pepper, jasmine, juniper, vetiver, lavender, patchouli, amber, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/71523.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Mmmm... Eau de Parfum,Juliette Has a Gun," In the words of Romano Ricci, MMMM... isa forbidden fruit. We say that if you've ever wanted to smell as sparkly and as desirable as those ruby slippers that Dorothy wore in The Wizard of Oz, then move a little closer please. MMMM... just uttering its name forces a little moan of pleasure to escape your mouth. Yes, it's a little embarrassing. You're a grown woman. But it is difficult to resist something so straight-forwardly delicious. This fragrance is nothing more than a vanilla cream puff infused with orange-scented neroli and dotted with raspberries. Flirty white florals, sandalwood, and patchouli add a touch of seriousness, but not much. Go on, gorge yourself silly while swinging your red ruby slippers back and forth. We're in no position to judge."," Neroli, raspberry, geranium, orange flower, jasmine sambac, tuberose, iris, patchouli, sandalwood, salicilates",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/40127.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, neroli
Lilac Love Eau de Parfum,Amouage," Disclaimer: this is not a lilac perfume. This is a lilac-colored angora sweater that you want to wear on your naked skin while rolling around on 1,000-thread count sheets with a basket of gray Persian kittens. It is a million miles away from the bold oriental regalia of the Amouage lineage  this one whispers, and has an adorable French accent. We can't get over how pretty Lilac Love is. A soft bouquet of roses, jasmine, gardenia, and heliotrope is whipped up into a rosy, milky froth, dusted liberally with cocoa powder, tonka bean shavings, and fresh vanilla sugar. The texture transitions fluently between a cool, floral milk (lactones, gardenia) to a warm, cocoa-like powder (iris, patchouli). You won't know whether to wear it or sip it from a mug while watching the snow fall outside your ski lodge."," Jasmine, rose, gardenia, peony, heliotrope, orris, cacao, tonka bean, sandalwood, patchouli, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/41869.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, jasmine
Jasmin Kama Eau de Parfum,Rania J.," Jasmin Kama is an excellent showcase for Egyptian jasmine, which is richly animalic, slightly coarse, and fruity. The word Kama brings to mind thoughts of the Kama Sutra, and why yes, this is one seriously carnal scent!A brilliant bergamot opens the show with a sour, bright citrus accent that fizzes violently enough to get your saliva glands working. A clutch of Egyptian jasmine blooms immediately begin to pump out a stream of inky, fecund indoles into the air, reminding the wearer that the aroma of jasmine is excitingly close to the smell of decay, sex, and rebirth. Heliotrope adds a powdery sparkle that balances out the inky, fruity jasmine, but earthy patchouli in the base drags jasmine further into the shadows. Simultaneously fresh and indolic, Jasmin Kama is a jasmine for those searching for a different take on this most sultry of white flowers."," Bergamot, Rosa Damascena, Jasmin (Jasmin Absolute, Egypt), Patchouli, Sandalwood, Heliotrope, Vanilla, Musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/751001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
T. Habanero Eau de Parfum,Rania J.," T. Habanero stuns with its unique portrayal of what happens when a fruity, stinky Cambodi oud meets a dark, nutty tobacco leaf. Imagine a thick stew of chocolatey spices fermenting in an oak barrel, and a man pouring in handfuls of dry tobacco leaves and oud wood chips, dark with resin. After a long soak, the drenched woods and tobacco leaves are spread out to bake under a hot sun, releasing a host of fruited, dark, fermented aromas. One doesn't know where the oud begins and the tobacco ends.The genius of this scent is that the perfumer knows how to pull all the chaotic, disparate elements of the scent into one harmonious whole, using a smooth, earthy myrrh to link the fungal dampness of the oud to the creamy sweetness of the tobacco leaf. What could have easily been a rough cacophony turns out to be a suave and sophisticated tobacco fragrance. A real tour de force."," Pink pepper, black pepper, cardamom, black tobacco, sandalwood, agarwood, incense, myrrh, leather",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/751002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, pink pepper
Lavande 44 Eau de Parfum,Rania J.," If you think you smelled every possible variation on the lavender theme, then think again. Rania J.'s Lavande 44 is a wholly unique take on the genre, mixing one part aromatics (green, fresh lavender bud) with one part animalics (oud, musk) and two parts resinous oriental (labdanum, tonka, patchouli). The result is stunning. A cube of sour citrus and aromatic lavender up top melts down through the fragrance structure, pooling in and around buttery tonka and providing little sparks of electric freshness to the dark, animalic oud. Vetiver root in the base joins with the lavender and patchouli to form a damp, salty breeze that makes one think of the humid air in a pine forest. A thoroughly modern way to wear lavender, Lavande 44 dispels all thoughts of shaving soap and sachets for the linen drawer."," Bergamot, Petitgrain, Lavender (Essential Oil and Absolute), Agarwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/751003.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Oud Assam Eau de Parfum,Rania J.," Oud virgins, look away now  Rania J.'s majestic Oud Assam features an authentic Indian oud oil that doesn't pull any punches. The juicy, bitter orange framing the opening notes only serves to highlight the creamy bleu cheese feel of the oud. But give it a moment to settle, and you'll begin to understand why Indian oud is considered the most spiritually uplifting type of oud. As the nose adjusts and the oud note begins to soften, one begins to discern the complex aromas of deep golden spice, leather, and fermented, creamy woodiness. A smell as ancient as time itself.Better yet, this is one Western oud that doesn't drift into aimless sweetness in the base. Instead, a nutty vetiver, peppery musk, and smoky incense contributes a fresh, woodsy character that makes one think of a great forest in a Northern clime. A genuine oud experience in this price bracket is a rarity  we recommend you take the leap."," Bergamot, Sweet Orange, Bitter Orange, Oud from India, Cedar, Vetiver, Frankincense, Black pepper, Tonka bean, Musk.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/751004.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Larmes du Desert Eau de Parfum,Atelier des Ors," Alive with exotic mysticism, Larmes du DÃ©sert is a smoky, spicy amber that glows like the warmth left infused in the desert sands well after the sun has gone down for the night. A smooth, captivating incense leads us through the swirling dunes into a world of seductive dry woods, rich patchouli, and the ethereal allure of golden amber and myrrh, possessed of divine potency and disarming pleasures. Noble, magical and beautiful, Larmes du DÃ©sert is a stunning new offering for women and men alike."," Incense, cypress, patchouli, gaiac, cedar, citrus, amber, myrrh",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/74402.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, incense
Amber Aoud Extrait de Parfum,Roja Parfums," A Rolls Royce in a sea of Volkswagens, Roja Dove's Amber Aoud sets out to best every other rose-oud out there by sheer dint of superior raw materials and blending. Expensive this may be, but Roja Dove puts his money where his mouth is. Taking a regally sour, spicy Indian oud, he buries it deep within the folds of a jammy rose, and then tucks the whole thing into the pulpy insides of a Moroccan fig. Almost obscenely rich and opulent at first, it wears like the inside of a red velvet cloak lined in ermine. But look closely and you will see the artful balance between sweet and sour, dusty and moist, sharp and smooth. There is structure and discipline within the avalanche of richness. Birch tar and incense resins and gums provide a smoky fade-out that proves to be excellent ballast for the jammy sweetness up top. No wonder that many oud aficionados cite this as the best example of Western oud perfumery- a point we'd find hard to dispute."," Bergamot, lemon, lime, fig, jasmine, rose, ylang ylang, ambergris, aoud wood, birch, cinnamon, civet, musk, oakmoss, orris, patchouli, saffron, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/74812.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Musk Aoud Extrait de Parfum,Roja Parfums," Imagine a courtly banquet hall, its walls hung with massive velvet tapestries, Irish wolfhounds lounging in fireplaces, heavy winter fur cloaks and sleeping animals strewn all around the stone floor. The High Priest lights his censer in a lull of conversation, and walks slowly through the hall, allowing thick plumes of smoke from fragrant incense resins and bitter dried herbs to circulate. Traders have brought a rare treasure for the King to look at  tiny shards of what they call oud wood. He burns a piece, and the air is suddenly pierced with a majestic aroma that comprises sour woodiness, smoke, rot, and a forest floor. This is what Musk Aoud smells like. All of this, all at once.Roja Dove's Musk Aoud is deeply, carnally suggestive. The musk is warm and suggestive of both animal and human fur. But what really rocks our boat is the current of smoky, oily sweetness running though the fragrance. The tensile weight here suggests centuries of smells packed in one on top of another, finally merging into one suggestive whole. We find it incredibly sexy. In fact, if we arrive at a bacchanalia and this scent isn't being pumped through the air ducts, then we're leaving."," Bergamot, lemon, jasmine, rose, ylang-ylang, agarwood, ambrette, birch, leather, musk, nutmeg, oakmoss, precious woods, sandalwood, tonka bean, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/74813.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Diaghilev Extrait de Parfum,Roja Parfums," Mitsouko reupholstered in more expensive fabrics? Since it is named for Sergei Diaghilev, founder of the Ballets Russes and someone who drenched the curtains in his bedroom and theatres with Mitsouko, it's tempting to think so. Insanely rich and opulent, Diaghilev takes the three pillars of the chypre  oakmoss, bergamot, and labdanum resin  and wraps them up in a length of the dusty red velvet curtain that's been hanging in the OpÃ©ra National de Paris for over a century.But that's only part of the story. After all, who would pay such a high price for a remake of Mitsouko? Diaghilev stands head and shoulders above all other chypres for two reasons. First, the quality of the raw materials  think the smoothest oakmoss, the inkiest vetiver, the most exquisite ambrette seed, and finest floral absolutes  makes for an experience so intoxicating that you just stop questioning the cost. Second, Roja Dove has flushed the perfume with sensual musks, civet, resins, overripe fruit, and castoreum, loosening the stays on that uptight chypre structure and making it impossible to wear without thinking about sex. Bitter, rich, and complex, Diaghilev is the scent of old books, musty theatres, velvet curtains soaked in Mitsouko, and the sheen of salty, lickable, post-coital sweat on your lover's skin. Put smelling Diaghilev on your bucket list."," Bergamot, lemon, lime, orange, tarragon, blackcurrant buds, heliotrope, jasmine, peach, rose, tuberose, violet, ylang ylang, ambrette, benzoin, cedarwood, civet, clove, cumin, guaiacwood, labdanum, leather, musk, nutmeg, oakmoss, patchouli, peru balsam, sandalwood, styrax, vanilla, vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/74815.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Nuwa Extrait de Parfum,Roja Parfums," Named for an ancient Chinese goddess known for creating mankind and repairing the pillars of heaven, and described by Roja Dove asThe Elixir of the Gods, it would seem that NÃ¼wa has a lot to live up to. Famously reformulated in 2015 to banish a heavy, animalistic cumin note, NÃ¼wa is now reborn as a floral oriental with a delicate transparency that jives better with its Chinese inspiration. It is simply exquisite. Now a gently-spiced floral with a peachy osmanthus heart and a backdrop of smoky black tea, NÃ¼wa is a fragrance to wear while strolling down the Riverside Promenade in Shanghai, slowly twirling a stiff silk umbrella over your head. Smoky resins and spice add exoticism, but never obscure the golden florals. Later on, a dusky jasmine accord moves in, and the effect is like walking under a pagoda dripping with jasmine vines at night, their warm, spicy scent snaking out into the warm air around you. If rose gold had a scent, it would be this."," Bergamot, lemon, blackcurrant buds, immortelle, jasmine, osmanthus, rose, ylang ylang ambergris, birch, black pepper, cistus, clove, cumin, oakmoss, orris, patchouli, storax, vetiver.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/74816.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Ambre Mythique Eau de Parfum,Maitre Parfumeur et Gantier," What makes a perfect amber? Some might say it's a perfectly smooth, balsamic texture; others might favor an exotic, attention getting heart. In the case of amber experts MaÃ®tre Parfumeur's newest entry, Ambre Mythique, we're lucky enough to get both, and as we can attest, it's truly magical. Built around MPG's renowned central amber accord of exquisite vanilla, labdanum and tonka, Ambre Mythique adds a touch of magical flair with rich notes of incense and myrrh, meant to evoke the mysticism of the shifting sands of the Omani desert at dusk. The result is an amber both comforting and fascinating, where silky smoothness meets entrancing smokiness, sweet enough to entice and mysterious enough to seduce. It's safe to say that the unquestioned masters of the amber fragrance still have a trick or two up their sleeves."," Bergamot, geranium, coriander, incense, myrrh, labdanum, lavender, patchouli, sandalwood, vanilla, tonka",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/29318.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
White Zagora Eau de Toilette,The Different Company," Vibrantly fresh, dynamically fruity, White Zagora is a zesty bolt of peach-infused sunshine from The Different Company's L'Espirit collection. Described as a ""sensual oriental"" fragrance, White Zagora certainly packs enough spicy floral and amber punch to meet the strict definition, but check your expectations of heaviness at the door- this is the oriental as ethereal, as bright, crisp and easy-to-wear as any fruity-floral we've ever smelled. White Zagora begins with an eye-opening zing of bergamot and citron, quickly smoothed out with a blissful heart of white florals and succulent peach blossom. Creamy osmanthus adds mouthwatering depth, while delicate, surprisingly cool amber and clean white musk keep the fruity floral tones alive for hours. Some fragrances overwhelm with layers within layers of complexity and challenge, while others stun with a simple ability to smell incredible without ever seeming dumbed down or commercial. White Zagora, with its wonderfully straightforward irresponsibility, is just that- simply marvelous."," Neroli, citron, bergamot, orange blossom, peach blossom, tuberose, osmanthus, white musk, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/25341.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, neroli

Layton Eau de Parfum,Parfums de Marly," Inspired by the colorful bustle of the Royal Court of Versailles, Layton, the newest fragrance from Parfums de Marly, bursts forth with a fresh, dynamic masculine elegance that perfectly embodies the festive yet elegant atmosphere of the 18th century's most important and luxurious seat of power. Layton opens with a dazzling splash of juicy, tangy bergamot and apple, tilted towards the alluringly masculine with fresh lavender, geranium and violet. Warm amber tones lend richness to the spicy heart, while a drydown of precious woods and vanilla up the opulence even further- perfect for a fragrance meant to evoke a name still synonymous with gloriously high-end excess. Life at Versailles must surely have been a dazzling mix of business, statecraft, leisure and celebration- it should come as no surprise that Layton presents itself as a perfect fragrance for any and all of those pursuits."," Bergamot, lavender, apple, mandarin, violet, jasmine, geranium, gaiac, patchouli, sandalwood, cardamom, vanilla, pepper",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70021.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Amber Sky Eau de Parfum,Ex Nihilo," Caught between east and west, between light and dark, between sensuous oriental and luxurious gourmand, Amber Sky is a gorgeously refined fragrance of two worlds. As the first fragrance from Babylone, Ex Nihilo's new oriental collection, it's a wondrous first glimpse of a unique brand of edgy but deliciously decadent luxury as only this inspired Parisian house could create. Amber Sky opens with an alluring blend of exotic spices, leading into a warm, unisex geranium. The amber is rich and compelling- warm and creamy, but with a bit more danger and intrigue than your typical dessert amber- woodsy, spicy and textured, glowing around the edges like a solar eclipse, the coriander and nutmeg of the opening still sparkling with distinction. Thus far, the secret genius of Ex Nihilo has been their ability to take conventional fragrance styles and imbue new, vivid life into them. In this re-invigoration of the amber style, Amber Sky proves yet another triumph."," Bergamot, coriander, nutmeg, geranium, amber, cedar, sandalwood, vanilla, tonka",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/72014.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Aurum Eau de Parfum,Kemi," Aurum- latin for gold, the King of Metals. Valued the world over not merely for its beauty, but because of its unique and special physical and chemical properties. Aurum the fragrance, the newest release from Kemi, is much the same- a golden treasure possessed not only of mere beauty, but of impossible balance between light and dark, gourmand and floral, and masculine and feminine. Aurum opens with a burst of floral freshness, as a rounded blend of crisp citrus notes leads into a wonderfully lush rose that will stay with us through the life of the fragrance. Fresh, juicy fruit and rich chocolate lend mouthwatering depth, while oakmoss, oud and incense provide mystery and sophistication. As delightfully magical as a chest of alchemists' gold, Aurum is a rare and precious treasure in its own right."," Rose, lemon, bergamot, orange, strawberry, chocolate, cistus, heliotrope, patchouli, oakmoss, vanilla, oud, incense, labdanum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/72409.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, rose
Rose Atlantic Eau de Parfum,D.S. and Durga," There's nothing quite like summertime in the posh coastal hamlets of the Atlantic coast: a classic blend of relaxation, adventure, tradition, and luxury. Rose Atlantic imagines you on the deck of a sailboat, toasting to the good life as the salt water blends with a bouquet of salt spray roses to perfume the air with good cheer. Fresh citrus stands in for the vivid sunlight, while a wonderfully fruity and rich rose accord feels not only vibrant and arresting but, with the electrifying ozonic notes in harmony, also surprisingly unisex. As you navigate towards a postcard-perfect white lighthouse in the far distance, a cool white moss sends soothing vibes from the coastline. Timeless, casually elegant, and suitable for just about everyone, Rose Atlantic is the scent of the perfect oceanside summer afternoon."," Bergamot, petals, lemon oil, linden, salt spray rose accord, dune grass, muscone, salt water, white moss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/68618.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Amber Room Eau de Parfum,Thameen," This molten scent of golden glow is inspired by the story of the Amber Room; a near mythical chamber originally constructed in Catherine the Great's Winter Palace near St Petersburg. Made from six tons of amber and decorated with pearls and precious stones, the mirrored, gilded and ambered walls reflected candlelight like fire. Rumours of its potential location come and go, but the Amber Room seems to have slipped away forever, leaving behind memories of jewelled excess and empirical vainglory. Thameen's shimmering composition is a rose at the heart of a spiced, radiant amber, dark and nuanced with cinnamon, honey and aromatic woods. A dash of bergamot adds beguiling sparkle as Amber Room opens on the skin, but it is this hypnotic candle rose effect reflecting off the lavish dose of molten amber like flames off gold in the original chamber that makes this perfume so irresistible to wear."," Cardamom, pink pepper, cypriol, cypress, cedar, patchouli, iris, oud, vetiver, amber, musk, labdanum, sandalwood, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/73400.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, cardamom
Gothic V- Perfume oil Perfume Oil Roll-On,Loree Rodkin," Spiritual and complex, Gothic V is a concentrated blend of exquisite eastern incense notes of astonishing complexity. Beginning with a delicate, almost floral lilt of green incense, it quickly opens up to showcase richer strains, some smokier, some darker, and all gorgeously smooth and enchanting. The effect is both mysterious and uplifting, imposing but never forbidding, and deep with enlightened sophistication. Loree Rodkin's marvelous creations have always been a wonder for incense lovers, but Gothic V may just be the new standard.", Incense,https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/21109.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, incense
Indian Wood Eau de Parfum,"Pierre Guillaume Paris, Parfumerie Generale"," With the original PG 11, Harmatan Noir, Pierre Guillaume explored the concept of a robust desert wind, carrying a powerful contrast of sweet lemon mint and Jamaican allspice on its warm, dry breezes. With 11.1, Indian Wood, Guillaume returns to the idea of the contrast between aromatics and spices, but this time the mint in question is piquant peppermint set against a rich, quintessentially Indian blend of nutmeg and cardamom, delivering a nose-tingling bouquet of energetic depth. A blend of moss and balsamic woods further adds to the robust character, while the innate dryness of the central accord is offset with a judicious touch of coconut milk. The overall effect seems to stand at the exact nexus of sweet and spicy, of warm and delicate, a balance so perfect that it seems simply effortless until one considers the contrary forces at work. Intoxicating, invigorating and playful, Indian Wood is another testament to the wondrous originality of Pierre Guillaume."," Sandalwood, vetiver, moss, spicy mint, nutmeg, cardamom, coconut milk, lemon zest",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/34550.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, sandalwood
Le Musc & La Peau Eau de Parfum,"Pierre Guillaume Paris, Parfumerie Generale"," For a perfect example of how Parfumerie Generale's ReWork Collection are much more than your ordinary ""flanker"" bottles, look no further than Le Musc & La Peau. Ostensibly based on the rich chocolate and hazelnut cult classic Musc Maori, Le Musc & La Peau isolates the original's to die for milky white musk blend and strips the gourmand away, replacing it with delicate florals and light, woodsy aromatics for a second skin of refined subtlety and astonishing complexity. A peak of vanilla and tonka bean still hint at the mouthwatering richness of the original, but now they hum with gentle restraint, weaving into the warm amber heart to make your skin radiate natural sensuality. A true skin scent, Le Musc & La Peau is perfectly suited as a warm, personal base to customize your favorite fragrance, but is equally ideal to be worn alone when you just want to smell like yourself- only better."," Bergamot, ambroxan, musk, aldehydes, rosemary, ylang-ylang, sandalwood, cedar, tonka bean",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/34549.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot

Rosas Secas Eau de Parfum,Coqui Coqui," The more dangerous cousin to the Rosas Frescas scent, Rosas Secas (dried roses) is a dry, sexy, and lightly powdery rose scent laced with a sweet and smooth vein of tobacco leaf.

Flor de Naranjo Eau de Parfum,Coqui Coqui," Intense, and exhilarating, Coqui Coqui's orange blossom draws its power from the native orange plants of the Yucatan, which are unique in their strength and distinctive sweetness. The results are an orange blossom far less bitter than most European takes on the fragrance, a surprisingly fresh Eau de Cologne with deep resonance and shocking longevity.

Oudmazing Eau de Parfum,Montale," If anyone knows how to make an oud fragrance ""Oudmazing, "" it would of course be Montale- the brand that did oud long before it was de rigueur. And Oudmazing,  with its audacious blend of exquisite Malaysian oud and a mouthwatering combination of fresh fruit,  citrus and rich leather,  more than fits the bill. Opening with brilliantly bright orange and bergamot,  Oudmazing is soon sweetened with a delectable Mediterranean fig note and a juicy burst of fresh pear. As the exotic,  resonant oud note uncurls itself,  it is accompanied with sensual floral notes of iris and Egyptian jasmine,  and a rich,  earthy patchouli and leather accord that complements the base of deep vanilla and white musk. If it all sounds too big and rich and juicy and wonderful to be contained,  you're not far off. But could anything less truly be considered Oudmazing?"," Orange, bergamot, pink grapefruit, pear, fig, iris, jasmine, patchouly, leather, vanilla, white musk.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/35447.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, orange
Bertrand Duchaufour Eau de Toilette,Project Renegades," What happens when one of niche fragrance's most prolific perfumers is given the freedom to have some fun? In Bertrand Duchaufour's case, he creates a modern, zesty blend of pink pepper, woods, and aquatic notes that- not to ruin the crazy imagery- comes out shockingly relaxed and lovely. Don't get us wrong, the vibrant, spicy opening has attitude to spare, with cardamom and the aforementioned pink pepper crackling against a fizzy gin note, but somewhere in the smooth, gently resinous heart, a drop of cassis meets a rich olibanum with such sweet smoothness that we can't help but close our eyes a moment and just enjoy it all. Once the salty, ocean-tinged woods of the base set in, we're downright transported- not to a bougie beach club, mind you, but perhaps the latter hours of an all-night full moon party in Koh Phangan, as the sun is just starting to peek over the horizon and the last people standing can take a deep exhale and marvel at the craziness fading into memory. And with a delightfully woodsy, fresh, and fun memory like this, you can be sure we'll be coming back again and again."," Pink pepper, bergamot, cardamom, gin, cassis, galbanum, red berries, olibanum, hinoki, balsam fir, driftwood, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/74000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, pink pepper
Geza Schoen Eau de Toilette,Project Renegades," When given the opportunity to go rogue, most perfumers might attempt to make the loudest, wildest, or most synthetically energetic fragrance of their career- but what if you've already made your whole career out of breaking the rules? In the case of visionary modernist perfumer Geza Schoen, you actually take a step towards naturalism, creating a fragrance that reinterprets pink pepper in the context of the entire tree, from berries to bark to leaves. Opening with a fresh, fruit-inflected top that merges a potent blast of pink pepper with juicy citrus and delicate, sweet and gently powdery cassis, the fragrance then adds impressive aromatic depth, with rich fir and green juniper that lend a deeply natural airy freshness. Even the warm, woodsy base balances out the dose of Iso-E Super- this is still Geza Schoen, after all- with creamy sandalwood and delicate moss, and even a dose of animalic musks to complete the illusion of a living tree with an entire ecosystem inside. Vibrant, compelling and surprisingly natural, Geza Schoen's Renegades fragrance is another triumph from a perfumer who's never been content to follow the leader."," Pink pepper, lemon, bergamot, cassis, lime, osmanthus, iris, fir, juniper, hedione, mate, iso-E super, cedar, sandalwood, labdanum, incense, myrrh, castoreum, ambrette",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/74001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, pink pepper
Bohea Boheme Eau de Parfum,Mona di Orio," Majestic and remote, the rocky, mineral-rich Wuyi Mountains of China has for centuries produced some of the most exquisite, and expensive, tea in the entire world. Bohea BohÃ¨me, the newest fragrance from Maison Mona di Orio, captures the inimitable spirit of this most precious substance, distilling the rich, smoky, fascinatingly complex essence of the tea once known worldwide as Bohea into a fragrance we can truly say is unlike any tea scent we've ever smelled before. The key to Bohea BohÃ¨me's marvelous complexity is the truly astounding variety of flavors in Wuyi tea itself- at once sweet, smoky, spicy, earthy, smooth and floral. Bohea BohÃ¨me opens with bright bergamot and a punch of sichuan pepper, invigorating and intense. Delicately powdery iris adds a wholly different element of subtlety, while a more full-bodied osmanthus melds with the smoky black tea heart to feel smooth and creamy in equal measure. Green geranium and warmer amber elements only enhance the impressively cohesive complexity, and as the gorgeously woodsy drydown gradually grows, the fragrance pulses with smooth, honeyed intensity that always remains on the right side of opulent. A fragrance based on a luxurious treasure must always be wary of coming up short by comparison; luckily, Bohea BohÃ¨me is destined for a legendary reputation all its own."," Bergamot, sichuan pepper, cardamom, iris, chamomile, balsam fir, boxwood, geranium, black tea, juniper, smoke, oak, sandalwood, beeswax, bay leaf, benzoin, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/51727.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Marfa Eau de Parfum,MEMO," A arid tuberose as singularly inspired as the West Texas oasis whose name it bears. Marfa, the new scent from MEMO, captures the elusive totality of this small, isolated city- modern art mecca, historic frontiertown, legendary nexus of paranormal and extraterrestrial activity- melding the glowing warmth of desert twilight with surprisingly sweet florals and modern musks to paint a portrait of a locale that straddles regions, cultures and time itself.Marfa opens with an immediate punch of orange blossom and tuberose, fruity and sweet but also surprisingly dry, imbued with surreal weightlessness. A highway of dry, gently smooth woods stretches ahead of us, and the haunting lights of the creamy, musky base glow with quiet intensity. The notes don't seem to make sense together, and yet the collective impression is undeniably cohesive, a place that shouldn't exist and yet thrives, replacing the logic of the rest of the world with something distinctive, alien, and unexpectedly beautiful. Equal parts austere and unabashed, bold and understated, challenging and downright lovely, Marfa isn't meant to be understood- at least, not until you find yourself deep in its heart, and realizing that you never want to leave."," Mandarin, orange blossom, agave, tuberose, ylang ylang, sandalwood, cedar, vanilla, white musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/69119.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, mandarin

Luckily, all four of the fragrances in the collected Colonia 1904 line, commissioned in 2015 to celebrate 111 years of Antica Barbieria Colla, are a perfect match, delivering fragrances that connect the modern man to the past with simple, compelling, invigorating scents.Colonia No. 1 is a near perfect example of a barbershop-fresh cologne, sparkling with bright citrus and sporting a rich, yet impossibly smooth, bouquet of fresh florals.

Colonia No. 4 Eau de Cologne,Antica Barbieria Colla," Any fragrance that bears the Antica Barbieria Colla name has a sacred obligation to uphold the timeless style and effortless sophistication of the legendary Milan shop, which has been delivering hot towel shaves and expert cuts to Italy's elite for a century.

From the vivacious, lemon-drenched opening, inflected with rich aromatic rosemary, to the mouthwateringly juicy heart of neroli, this is a fragrance that celebrates sunshine-filled days and carefree pursuits. Lavender and cedarwood prevent the composition from ever feeling childish or overly feminine, but that's no reason to exclude women, or for that matter, kids- this is truly a fragrance anyone, of any age, can wear with a smile on their face."," Lemon, rosemary, lavender, neroli, jasmine, cedarwood, coumarin",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/73715.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, lemon
Carved Oud Extrait de Parfum,Thameen," This compelling blend of divine woods, patchouli and an elegantly parched oud is a scent of adornment and ritual, inspired by the Solah Shringar or sixteen adornments, a handed down ceremonial set of symbolic customs applied to Hindu brides during the wedding preparations. These detailed ordinances govern jewellery and decoration for the hair, face hands, feet and eyes. The original belief was the beautification of the sixteen body parts would protect the bride against any negative effects of the moon cycle. The rootiness of a malachite vetiver note supports the ligneous oud and an unusually nutty patchouli. A gasp of antiseptic cypriol and cypress is key as woods and powerful musks drop into skin. There is subtle power at play in Carved Oud, just enough glitter and pomp to impress, but the devil is in the graven oud, reserved and immaculate but oh-- that smoky gaiac finish-- will seduce you."," Oud, cedar, gaiac, patchouli, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/73401.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, oud
Noorolain Taif Eau de Parfum,Thameen," Noorolain Taif is a peppery rose composition, a collision of Taif and Turkish roses lavishly dusted with pink and black peppers and a crackle of toasted coriander seed. A glimpse of jasmine glows amid the rose, just enough to add a sense of dirty sunshine. This vivacious opening is fabulous and a perfect homage to the Noor-ul-Ain or Light of the Eye that inspired it, one of the world's largest pink diamonds, mounted into a sublime tiara of the same name made by American jeweller Harry Winston. The oval brilliantine gemstone is a very singular shade of pink and this somehow feels brilliantly reflected in the glittering cannonade of rosaceous pepper at the top. Noorolain Taif is a gutsy, if not savoury experience, smoothing out as it settles into the base notes of agarwood, amber and potent cashmeran. It is a moody and regal fragrance, befitting its in namesake, but it has beautiful rose charisma and graceful longevity of hour upon spiced hour on the skin."," Orange, coriander, pink pepper, taif rose, rose absolute, jasmine, vetiver, cashmere wood, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/73405.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, orange
Regent Leather Eau de Parfum,Thameen," This is a scent of surface, texture and finish; a deluxe and malleable composition of golden saffron-licked leather effects, unexpected citrus sparks and a purring vanilla finish. Regent Leather is a collaboration with the Rolls Royce Enthusiasts Club and pays olfactory homage to bespoke interiors, driving gloves and that elusive oh-so-desired scent of sumptuous automobile leather. The cistus in the heart of the scent, while subtle, is vital to the creation of this animalic interior, riffing off the creaminess of the saffron to suggest supple skin and spiced heat. There is a sense of being cocooned; the later gutsy base notes of smoky gurjum, cedar and spiky patchouli suggest engine growl and sunlight on seats."," Vanilla, lemon, saffron, labdanum, gurjum, cedar, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/73406.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, vanilla
Love Shot Eau de Parfum,Ex Nihilo," In the most romantic city in the world, classicism and sensuality are far from opposites, which is precisely how Love Shot, the newest fragrance from Ex Nihilo, manages to feel both opulently nostalgic and seductively carnal all at once. Modeled after the most iconic Parisian creations of the seventies, Love Shot is a grand, enveloping chypre rich with floral presence, but also intertwined with the sly, modern signature we've come to expect from this powerhouse line. Love Shot indeed opens with the explosives its name might suggest, a fabulous and energetic punch of fruitiness and lively florals in the form of pink berries and lush peony.

Geisha Vanilla Hinoki- Eau de Parfum,Aroma M," Vanilla scents tend to have a cloying, candied effect.  But not Geisha Vanilla Hinoki.  Its key ingredient is a woodsy, smoky vanilla found only in Moroccoand very hard to come by. Five years in the making, perfumer Maria McElroy blended this delicacy with unexpected partner: Hinoki, a storied cypress. For centuries, this prized Japanese wood was used to build palaces, temples, shrines-- and those lingering hot spring pools known as onsen, found in mountainside inns. Maria's intention with this new scent was to capture the cloudy, floating, sybaritic sensation of lingering in one of these scented hot springs. Geisha Vanilla Hinoki, a nighttimeor should we say bedtime--potion is a truly unique approach to the world's most popular gourmand. Hypnotic, spiritual, and simply gorgeous."," Bergamot, hinoki, lavender, leather, patchouli, amyris, cedarwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/11140.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot

With Super Cedar, Byredo deftly weaves these attributes together, presenting a fragrance that sings of log cabins and clean Scandanavian furniture- modern yet comfortingly warm, energetic yet relaxed, and uniquely Swedish yet universally wearable.

Inspired by an 18th-century Jean-Philippe Rameau opera, FÃªtes Persanes is a truly exotic composition, weaving melodies of sumptuous Persian spice- cardamom, clove, cinnamon- against a smooth, lavish backdrop of gaiac and cedar wood and gorgeously creamy vanilla. The results are both energetic and narcotic, dreamy and invigorating, comfortingly familiar and alluringly unique.

A tale that began long ago turns into love, a promise of enchantment is fulfilled. It is with these words from an ancient Chinese love poem that the Altaia founders consider the magical providence of their own first meeting, amongst the fragrant Mediterranean orange groves of Southern Italy, 140 years after their ancestors first crossed paths in Argentina. Yu Son combines a mouthwatering, juicy burst of mandarin with smooth, cooling green tea and rich, natural orange blossom absolute, resulting in a fragrance of deeply resonant Mediterranean freshness with distinctly Asian flourishes. As the poem suggests, Yu Son lives in the space between infatuation- bright, exhilarating and kinetic- and love- rich, warm and deeply satisfying. The results are a fragrance with the power to both captivate and comfort, a true thing of beauty."," Mandarin, green tea, jasmine, iris, labdanum, amber, gaiac",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/73302.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, mandarin

Boundlessly deep, hypnotically tranquil, this scent seems to possess an elemental potency, deploying sweet, weightless florals, crisp myrtle and a gently smoky cedarwood and vetiver combination that stirs beneath the placid surface like the electricity of an approaching thunderstorm. A languid vanilla and cloudy patchouli only further perpetuate the captivating complexity, signalling marvelous sophistication without ever raising the volume above a constant and soothing hum. Despite the name, Ennui Noir is anything but boring; rather, it presents a meditative challenge of thought over action meant for those with the spiritual fortitude to find deep meaning beneath still waters."," Lavender, myrtle, cedar, heliotrope, patchouli, vanilla, vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/71904.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, lavender

The Orchid Man Eau de Parfum,Frapin," The Orchid Man is named for Georges Carpentier, an early 20th century French boxer whose elegant style and myriad accomplishments in and out of the ring made him a Parisian icon. Built around the intriguing duality of boxing, a sport with both intensely cerebral and shockingly violent demands, The Orchid Man opens with action, a rough-and-tumble black pepper stinging like a well-placed jab, while airy bergamot lends a zesty, fruit-like feel. The heart is a jasmine and leather accord both unapologetically masculine and also proudly floral, like the orchid boutonniere that Carpentier was famed for wearing about town. A mossy, delicately earthy base wears casual but dignified, lending The Orchid Man the type of adaptable versatility that boxers train their entire lives for. Sophisticated yet instantly likable, stout yet proudly delicate, The Orchid Man is a fragrance for the renaissance man in us all."," bergamot, black pepper, jasmine, leather, amber, oakmoss, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/22618.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot

Another Oud Eau de Parfum,Juliette Has a Gun," Leave it to the always-playful, always-daring Juliette Has A Gun line to say what's on everyone's mind: another oud? We're the first to admit that the trend is growing a bit long in the tooth. But in perfume, as with all art, there's nothing new under the sun- what matters is how you execute, and Another Oud, all joking aside, is a refreshingly light spin on the style, a fruit-inflected, luminously light oud scent with youthful style and fun to spare. Opening with a juicy melange of citrus and tart, sweet raspberry, Another Oud presents a version of agarwood that's miles removed from the loud, dark, overspiced medicinal ouds that make up so many mediocre recent releases. This is an oud that's light on its feet, velvety-soft with a cool spiciness that never overwhelms or screams at top volume, and deftly incorporates the sweetness of the fruit-laden opening for an additional dose of playfulness. Cradled on the drydown by an ambroxan-led muskiness that's well at home amongst the other Juliette releases, Another Oud is an all-seasons, all-occasions appropriate fragrance that maybe- just maybe- justifies keeping the oud trend afloat for a little while longer."," Bergamot, raspberry, oud, norlimbanol, musk, ambroxan",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/40125.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot

Imagine our joy when we took our first sniff of Tacit- their first brand-new fragrance release in 10 years- and discovered a stunningly bright, invigoratingly aromatic green scent with enough character and versatility to be a dynamic everyday scent for pretty much anybody. Opening with a mouthwatering, yuzu-led bouquet of citruses, Tacit quickly distinguishes itself with a strikingly intense green heart featuring an impressive amount of Grand Vert basil, the spicy, dashing variation of the plant grown in the Mediterranean. In the base, an earthy, well-spiced vetiver is given an extra zap of character from an invigorating blend of cloves for a fresh, spicy, natural-feeling fragrance to the very last sniff. Inspired by the fresh notes of traditional colognes, and also by the rugged beauty of the wildest parts of the Mediterranean coast, Tacit incorporates these elements with the signature aesthetic of Aesop to create something altogether unique, compelling, and effortlessly wearable. If you see us this summer, there's a very good chance this is what you'll be smelling."," Yuzu, citrus notes, basil, vetiver, clove",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/30148.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, yuzu
Night Flower Eau de Parfum,ERIS Parfums," It's 3am and she's in four-inch stilettos, sauntering home in perfect dÃ©shabillÃ© chic wearing a silk charmeuse gown, draped in vintage fur, and smoking a cigarette without a care in the world who sees... and Night Flower would be the perfume she'd wear. She's not meek or overly polite, and she likes her perfume like she lives her life: headstrong, decadent, and never prim and proper. A creamy tuberose is her fragrant weapon of choice, a sultry white blossom scent that's been a narcotic muse in perfumery for time immemorial. In Night Flower, it's sweet and buttery, contemporary and decidedly non-cloying, its larger-than-life-ness tethered by the gourmand scents of peppery-citrus bergamot, spicy-sweet cardamom, dry cinnamon, and a vanilla-esque tonka bean. A smoldering, almost leathery birch tar enhanced with soft suede is woven throughout, giving fair warning that this femme fatale of a perfume is anything but predictable or tame."," Bergamot, birch tar, cardamom, suede accord, tuberose, cinnamon, patchouli, tonka bean, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/72901.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Ma Bete Eau de Parfum,ERIS Parfums," The soul of Ma BÃªte is anything but conventional...but its heart beats with classic beauty and contemporary passion. The honeyed, almost citrus-like neroli and heady warmth of jasmin sambac are the beauties in charge here, leading the grounded notes at its base astray, bringing them to their knees not through raw power but with finesse. BÃªte is not a brash, in-your-face floral, nor is it ruled by untamed earthiness; it's all about the dance, the give and take, the unleashed femininity of sparkling, aldehyde-enhanced florals wrapped around the gentle, resinous warmth of cypriol, nutmeg and styrax. The anchoring scents of cedar, animalic notes and light touches of patchouli are reserved, but they drive an evolution so remarkable it becomes almost a wholly new fragrance as time passes. Where you start with this one is not where you end up, begging the question: what is beauty without her beast?"," Neroli, aldehydes, nutmeg, cypriol, styrax, Jasmin sambac, cedarwood, patchouli, animalic accord",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/72902.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, neroli

Baccarat Rouge 540 Eau de Parfum,Maison Francis Kurkdjian," In the Fall of 2014, Baccarat, the most prestigious and opulent crystalworks in the world, celebrated the 250th anniversary of their founding by releasing an extraordinary crystal decanter containing a luminous, exclusive fragrance created by Francis Kurkdjian. Only 250 of these bottles were produced, for a price of $4000 apiece. Now, for the first time ever, this spectacular fragrance is available to the world as Baccarat Rouge 540, a gorgeously woody floral-amber equal parts transparent, dense, and intense. MFK describes Rouge 540 not in terms of top, heart and base notes, but rather as the interplay between three unique accords, each lending a distinct and visceral characteristic. The ""breeze"" accord, jasmine and saffron, sits sheer and delicately spiced on the skin, leading way for the cedar-driven blend of woods that make up the robust and crackling ""heat"" accord. Finally, a ""mineral"" accord of ambergris seems simultaneously warm and cool, delivering deceptively straightforward depth to mimic the sophistication of Baccarat Crystal itself.

Les Indes Galantes Eau de Parfum,Parfums MDCI," With Les Indes Galantes, Parfums MDCI continues the exotic journey around 18th century Asia that was started with this year's Cio Cio San. But while Cio Cio immersed us in the pastel loveliness of Edo-era Japan, Les Indes Galantes whisks us thousands of miles south-west, to the vibrantly colorful worlds of India's long-lost Mughal Empire and British Ceylon. The results are a sumptuous, creamy, spice-laden delight, a complex and enchanting fragrance that walks the line between mouthwatering gourmand and exotic oriental with tantalizing confidence. Les Indes Galantes opens with a zesty burst of light, as sun-drenched bergamot and juicy orange and raspberry explode off the skin, with a ribbon of rich almond subtly hinting at the gourmand complexity underneath. In the robust heart, the full oriental spice bouquet shimmers, with rich Persian cinnamon and fiery clove supporting the ravishing vanilla that defines much of Les Indes Galantes latter phases. Supported with a subtly powerful leather and smooth, ambery labdanum, the vanilla thrums in rhythm to the spice blend, seducing us with its wondrously creamy fullness, but never drowning out the complexity of the other notes.

Oud Vendome Eau de Parfum,Ex Nihilo," There's no question that oud is the ""it"" ingredient of modern perfumery, but so many oud scents are so content to re-hash the tried-and-true combinations that we can't help but feel that the ""modern"" part of it has gotten a bit lost. Not so with Oud VendÃ´me, a genuinely modern oud that folds the smoky, intensely full-bodied titular ingredient fully into the contemporary Parisian chic style that Ex Nihilo does with such panache. Oud VendÃ´me opens with a spicy touch of saffron set against crackling ginger and cinnamon, balanced for the perfect burst of fresh, modern energy.

Instead, the tuberose holds sway, balancing the floral lushness with enough of the star ingredient's distinct, minty naturalism to maintain the Jeroboam line's uniquely modern style.

We don't know if chai tea was the actual inspiration for this scent, but it does indeed remind us of it. The sweet, fresh, spicy facets reveal the delicious delights of honey. Absolutely yummy, with a luxurious coziness that you want to wrap around you like a cashmere throw. Top it off with a luscious vanilla drydown and you have one irresistible fragrance."," Ginger, cinnamon, green anise, honey, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/15200.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, ginger

Luminous Calabrian bergamot lights the way to a floral heart of sumptuous Bulgarian rose and rich Egyptian jasmine, empowered by warm oriental notes of patchouli from Sumatra. In the luminous drydown, a warm silage of sensual white musk and powder gives off a wondrously hazy glow, like an evening under the stars you never want to end. A true nocturnal treasure from the house of Montale."," Lemon, bergamot, apple, patchouli, rose, jasmine, powder, amber, white musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/35474.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, lemon
Upper Ten Eau de Parfum,Lubin," The Upper Ten Thousand- or ""Upper Ten""- was the phrase coined by the American poet Nathaniel Parker Willis in 1850 to refer to the captains of industry and uniquely self-made aristocrats who willed America from an uncertain experiment into the global titan of the Industrial Age. To honor their success and the national culture that sprung up around it, the house of Lubin has reimagined Upper Ten, originally released in 1920, to represent the scent of the corridors of power. Upper Ten is redolent of cedar, sandalwood and fine leather with a delicate floral touch of geranium. Smooth, spicy cardamom wraps itself around the woody notes, while cinnamon invigorates and excites. The musky amber base brings potency and depth, conferring confidently reassuring strength."," Bergamot, cardamom, bay rose, saffron, juniper berry, cinnamon, geranium essence, leather, peach, orange blossom, cedar, sandalwood, patchouli, amber, white musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/31222.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
LAVS Parfum Extrait,UNUM," Enter the dream world of LAVS where purity and spirituality converge in the hushed recesses of a holy sanctum. White clouds embrace you with the cleanest incense that has been dusted with spices, warmed with amber and sweet myrrh, and then deepened with aromatic pine,  elemi, and dark resins. In its drydown, the clouds part to reveal ambered incense laced with a plush creaminess, soft woods, and hints of nutty sweet myrrh. Sacred, mysterious, powerful, and contemplative, LAVS fills you with a serenity that made it the choice for two Popes to scent their holy vestments. Yet, we think the fragrance has a universal appeal, evoking not only the radiance of ancient ceremonies, but also joyful celebrations and the innocence of childhood. Try it, and see for yourself."," Jasmine, Cardamom, Black Pepper, Elemi, Coriander, Clove, Carnation, Labdanum, Opoponax, Palisander Rosewood, Amber, Oakmoss, Tonka Bean",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/71900.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, jasmine
Black Prestigium Eau de Parfum,Mancera," An intoxicating combination of a woodsy chypre scent mixed with an intense floral leather, Black Prestigium has the self-assured sophistication and stylish presence of old-world royalty. Asserting itself from the very opening with an indulgently rich dose of orris blended with patchouli and bergamot that emphasize both fresh and earthy tones, Black Prestigium quickly adds a deep floral heart to the equation, with lush rose and sweet violet atop deep, vibrating woodsiness. As smoky oud and leather join the ever-increasing symphony, the orris continues to shine, each sniff revealing a new dance partner that accentuates a different element of this astonishing natural ingredient. The results are breathtakingly diverse, yet utterly cohesive. A fragrance for special people and special occasions, Black Prestigium may be Mancera's most opulent fragrance yet."," Bergamot, orris, spices, patchouli, rose, violet, oud, cedar, gaiac, sandalwood, amber, leather, white musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64929.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Aoud Vanille Eau de Parfum,Mancera," Warm, rich, mysterious and striking, Aoud Vanille is a captivating scent that hovers between oriental and gourmand. The aoud here is front and center, anchoring a powerful opening of sharp agarwood, savory cardamom and redolent saffron that quickly disavow any notions that this will be an overly dessert-y pushover. A floral heart softens things slightly in transition to the vanilla-driven base, but it's a vanilla with backbone, anchored by a full bodied woodsiness that confirms Aoud Vanille's unisex bona fides and keeps the central vein of aoud detectable for hours. If Aoud Vanille is a gourmand, then it's one reminiscent of bold, adventurous cooking from a top tier chef; if it's an oriental, it's swathed in the precise, creamy comfort of a grand master. We'd prefer to think of it as the best of both worlds."," Oud, saffron, black pepper, cardamom, floral notes, vanilla, gaiac, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64928.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, oud
Cologne 352 Eau de Parfum,Ex Nihilo," It's easy to fool yourself into thinking all cologne-style fragrances are the same- fresh, fleeting, and, dare we say, forgettable. But while Cologne 352 keeps the crisp citrus top notes and energetic orange blossom of an Italian classic, the signature scent of Ex Nihilo's Rue Saint-HonorÃ© boutique is a different kind of cologne- one with a surprisingly lush floral component and a substantive woody-musky drydown that make this particular cologne uniquely, distinctly Parisian. Opening with a gentle yet brisk splash of Italian lemon made aromatic with a tinge of juniper, Cologne 352 builds to a sophisticated crescendo of orange blossom softened with rose and delicate muguet, presenting crisp and lush notes that evoke morning strolls through Latin Quarter gardens. In the lovely, lingering drydown, a substantive dose of cedar, gaiac and musk gives Cologne 352 a staying power that its Italian ancestors can only dream of, and a unisex appeal impossible to deny. Whether you love cologne or not, you've never tried one like Cologne 352."," Lemon, juniper, crushed leaves, orange blossom, rose, lily of the valley, white cedar, gaiac, white musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/72001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, lemon
Bois d'Hiver Eau de Parfum,Ex Nihilo," ""An iron fist in a velvet glove, "" Bois d'Hiver is a seductive ode to contrast,  where spicy,  powerful woods and powdery musks intertwine with astounding fluency to create a scent that can only be described as equal parts striking and smooth.Bois d'Hiver opens with a hypnotically spiced blend of pink pepper and cardamom,  both sourced from Givaudan's industry-best Orpur naturals. The electricity of the spices gives way gradually to a robust cedar-and-sandal woodsiness rounded with smooth,  clean florals,  while a rich Indonesian patchouli lends just the right amount of earthy body. In the drydown,  a base of powdery,  exquisitely fine musk counterbalances the woods,  producing an alluringly symbiotic fragrance both modern and compellingly easy to wear. Your contradictions are what make you dynamic. Shouldn't the same go for your fragrance?"," Pink pepper, cardamom, heliotrope, cyclamen, white cedar, sandalwood, patchouli, cypriol, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/72000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, pink pepper
Rose of No Man's Land Eau de Parfum,BYREDO," Rose of No Man's Land is a uniquely beautiful and soothing rose scent presented for an especially worthy cause. Developed in collaboration with supermodel Freja Beha Erichsen, Rose of No Man's Land is dedicated to the praiseworthy work of MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃ¨res (Doctors Without Borders), an independent medical humanitarian organization that delivers emergency aid to people affected by armed conflict, epidemics, natural disasters and exclusion from healthcare.Rose of No Man's Land is centered around the delicate petals of a Turkish rose, both strikingly lush and softly sweet. A radiant chord of raspberry gives the heart notes fruit-laden depth, while a papyrus wood base and white amber chord add an eternal and sophisticated aura, delivering, in total, a rosebud of immense purity.For each bottle of Rose of No Man's Land sold, Byredo pledges to contribute a portion of the sale to Doctors Without Borders."," Pink pepper, Turkish rose petals, raspberry blossom, Turkish rose absolute, papyrus, white amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64183.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, pink pepper
10 Corso Como Eau de Parfum,10 Corso Como," 10 Corso Como is exotic sensuality, the meeting of the arcane and the new. It's a clean, warm sandalwood with a touch of churchy frankincense and an ingredient so expensive, so precious, so rare that we dare not speak its name but once. This is not your local headshop's version of sandalwood, so forget about multi-colored dancing bears and hookahs; 10 Corso Como's mystery is rooted in one of the most ancient of all incenses, yet it remains light on the skin, exuding a scent both delicate and intensely spiritual. Without a single ad campaign, 10 Corso Como has attracted so many crazed worshippers in Europe that some buy the bottles by the dozen. Welcome to paradise."," sandalwood, frankincense, musk, rose, geranium, vetiver and rare Malay oud wood oil",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/12400.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, sandalwood
African Leather Eau de Parfum,MEMO," For the fourth installment of the Cuirs Nomades series, exploring various facets of leather scents through a global journey, MEMO has abandoned the peculiar comforts of Europe (previous editions in this series were French, Italian and Irish) for a taste of the wild. Like the bright Kenyan sun above the plains of the Serengeti, African Leather is at once impossibly vibrant and undeniably full of life, a deeply aromatic, richly spiced floral leather with all the soulfulness and natural magnetism of the world's last unspoiled habitat. African Leather opens with a burst of gorgeously vivid exoticism, as stunningly bright bergamot illuminates a wondrous and wild blend of green, herbal spices, cardamom, cumin and saffron combining for a hugely evocative, ruggedly sensual set of top notes. In the grassy, floral heart, wild vetiver combines with a stunning geranium absolute that delivers commanding depth and a feral edge that rolls perfectly into the titular leather, a majestically unpolished, animalic leather that evokes tooth and fur, hide and claw, feeling as savagely regal as the great beasts of the savannah. Take an unforgettable journey with African Leather, and get in touch with your wild side."," Bergamot, cardamom, saffron, cumin, geranium, patchouli, oud, leather, vetiver, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/69118.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Messy Sexy Just Rolled Out of Bed Eau de Parfum,A Lab on Fire," Everyone loves the smell of vanilla, and yet somehow the perfect, universally wearable vanilla seems elusively rare- mouthwatering bakery gourmands scare away lovers of wispier, more floral concoctions, and both varieties are often seen as too feminine for men to wear. This is why we're so enthused with Dominique Ropion's brilliant creation for A Lab On Fire-- a just-right vanilla musk that we think smells divine on just about anyone. This enchanting elixir is sweet without seeming gooey, compelling without shouting in your face, and romantic with enough restraint to wear well on men and women alike. A soft rose lends its velvety tones throughout, darting in and out among the star players of clean musk, rich tonka bean absolute, vanilla, and amber. The ever-so-slightly powdery almond notes of heliotrope are the perfect complement, softening and rounding out the sweet toffee and barely-there blonde woods. Messy Sexy Just Rolled Out of Bed is a season-spanning wonder, displaying a warming sweet coziness on cool fall days, while bergamot and peach blossom bring a fresh, light addition to summer sunshine. With versatility like that, it's no wonder that Messy Sexy Just Rolled Out of Bed is one of the best crowd-pleasing vanillas we've ever put our noses on.Formerly known as Mon Musc a Moi. Messy Sexy Just Rolled Out of Bed is the same perfume, now with a new name."," Bergamot, peach blossom, rose, heliotrope, musk, toffee, amber, white woods, vanilla, tonka bean",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/56713.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Santal Eau de Toilette,Floris London," Taking its inspiration from an original sandalwood fragrance that dates back to the 1800s, Santal EDT modernizes a classic by lending it a distinctive, contemporary edge. Santal opens with crisp bergamot and lemon zest cut through with fresh notes of green grass and a spicy blend of black peppercorns, clove bud, green cardamom and nutmeg. The warmth of the spices merges with the lavender in fougÃ¨re accord as the sensual woody notes of sandalwood, cedarwood, patchouli and vetiver unfold and are augmented by the oriental base notes of frankincense, musk and vanilla."," Bergamot, black pepper, cardamom, green grass, lemon, clove bud, lavender, nutmeg, amber, cedarwood, frankincense, musk, sandalwood, vetiver, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/71511.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Elite Eau de Toilette,Floris London," Introduced in 1979, Elite was named after Lotion Elite  a Floris after shave cream that dates back to 1851. Based around mellow woodsy notes, Elite turns up the intrigue with a cool citrus twist of bergamot, lemon and orange punctuated with green resinous notes of cedar leaf and spicy juniper berry. Lavender and fir balsam with a touch of bay are key to the character of the heart and are reinforced by the woody notes of patchouli and vetiver. Mossy notes then play a leading role as the fragrance evolves with amber, musks and a hint of leather in the base."," Bergamot, cedar leaf, grapefruit, juniper, petitgrain, fir, lavender, bay leaf, amber, oakmoss, musk, cedar, patchouli, vetiver, leather",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/71508.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
No. 89 Eau de Toilette,Floris London," Orange and bergamot blended with lavender and neroli give No.89 its classical cologne aspect. Warmed with a touch of spicy nutmeg, the floral heart is underscored by the dominant woody accord of sandalwood, cedarwood and vetiver in this quintessentially English gentleman's fragrance.No 89 takes its name from the number of the Floris shop in Jermyn Street. Introduced in 1951, it has amassed generations of devoted followers including James Bond creator Sir Ian Fleming."," Bergamot, lavender, neroli, nutmeg, orange, petitgrain, geranium, rose, ylang ylang, cedarwood, musk, oakmoss, sandalwood, vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/71509.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Voulez-Vous Coucher Avec Moi Eau de Parfum,By Kilian," Lush, seductive, and more than a little dangerous, Voulez-Vous Coucher Avec Moi is a fragrance of nocturnal temptations, where the darkness of night leaves pleasure seekers free to explore their deepest desires far from prying eyes. Lush, woodsy and mouthwateringly sumptuous, the latest from Kilian's In The Garden Of Good And Evil is a bona fide delight- being wicked never smelled this delicious.Like joining an all-night party in full swing, Voulez-Vous opens with its full-bodied florals already singing, the sweetness of the ylang and lushness of Bulgarian rose playing off of the creamy, narcotic tuberose. As a rich, lusciously creamy vanilla with a sexy cedarwood kicker grow in intensity, we're positively swept away in the sensuous festivities. Cancel your plans for tomorrow, because Voulez-Vous Coucher Avec Moi is going to keep you away from home until the sun comes up."," Neroli, ylang ylang, tuberose, gardenia, Bulgarian rose, vanilla, cedarwood, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/425004.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, neroli
Ambre Cashmere Intense Eau de Parfum,PARFUMS DE NICOLAI," Warm, creamy and deliciously sweet, Ambre Cashmere Intense is a delectable gourmand that marks a bright new era for Parfums de Nicolai- the first scent created by Patricia de Nicolai in collaboration with her son, Axel. And lovers of the sweet will have ample reason to celebrate the new arrangement, as Ambre Cashmere Intense is a richly sugared lemon-vanilla delight with a heart of sophisticated, buttery iris and a warm amber drydown that has us swooning. From the beginning, Ambre Cashmere Intense presents itself as more than your average gourmand, with a tingling black pepper leading the way into the sweet, intensely vanillic lemon. A strong dose of iris butter forms a delicately floral richness in the fragrance's heart alongside the dominant vanilla absolute, while a patchouli-inflected amber accord settles in for a long, comforting drydown as cozy as a fragrance named ""cashmere"" might suggest. Indulgent, mouthwatering and deeply relaxing, Ambre Cashmere Intense is gourmand bliss, on demand."," Black pepper, mandarin, lemon, orris butter, violet, clove, vanilla absolute, labdanum, benzoin, tonka bean, patchouli, sandalwood, musk, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/31353.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, black pepper
Jasmin Angelique Cologne Absolue,Atelier Cologne," When most fragrance houses announce a jasmine scent, it doesn't necessarily move the needle, but as a house dedicated solely to cologne-style compositions, the notably indolic, sensual white flower might seem a bit more challenging. Luckily for us, Jerome Epinette and Atelier Cologne have done it again- Jasmin AngÃ©lique is a stunning, crisply complex cologne absolue that balances layers of herbaceous green notes against a lovely, lilting jasmine accord that feels natural, fresh and warmly comforting. Jasmin AngÃ©lique opens with a crisp, spicy burst of Sicilian lemon, set against a fiery, energetic kick of Sichaun pepper that's quickly balanced by a floral yet fresh jasmine, resinous galbanum, and a lovely green fig note, which together give the impression of breathing deeply while walking through a meadow on a warm spring afternoon. This wondrous sensation lingers for hours, until slowly warming into the smooth, warm and light amber drydown. Vivid, green and aromatic, Jasmin AngÃ©lique is wholly unlike any jasmine fragrance we've tried before- and that's precisely what we love about it."," Lemon, Sichuan pepper, angelique, jasmine, galbanum, fig, incense, white amber, tonka bean",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/51029.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, lemon
Iris Cendre Eau de Parfum,Naomi Goodsir," Enigmatic, elegant and enchanting, the iris is one of perfumery's most treasured ingredients- and also one of its most challenging. So when we heard that Naomi Goodsir's first-ever floral was to be named Iris CendrÃ© (or ""Iris Ash""), our hearts began to flutter with anticipation of an Iris fragrance that might transcend convention and offer a bold new portrait of this beloved material. And even beyond our wildest dreams, Goodsir and perfumer Julien Rasquinet have delivered a bona fide masterpiece- a lush, warm, buttery interpretation of iris with a gorgeously restrained hint of smokiness that feels both wonderfully creative, and quintessentially Naomi Goodsir.Before even the first spray, Iris CendrÃ© affirms its rarity with a striking green color that results from its uniquely high concentration of true iris concrete, a property that gives the fragrance its striking depth and nuance. While the opening presents a crisp, delicately fruity burst of bergamot and spiced tangerine, the rich heart of buttery iris soon takes over, displaying a gorgeously evocative facet of the flower with warmer, more sultry tones than we've ever before found in an iris scent. A light veil of violet reinforces the floral depth, while a sensually smoky accord of cistus, tobacco and amber evokes the distinctly complex drydown of another Naomi Goodsir classic, Bois D'Ascese. The overall effect is both subtle and striking, a wholly unisex floral that seems to contain multitudes without ever raising its voice, feeling vivid and deep but also masterfully restrained. With Iris CendrÃ©, Naomi Goodsir and Julien Rasquinet have redefined what we thought an iris scent could be and in doing so, created a new reference."," Bergamot, tangerine, orris butter, violet, amber, cistus, tobacco",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/59304.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Incense Flash Eau de Parfum,Tauerville," For the third entry in his joyfully creative Tauerville project, Andy Tauer turns his attention to an ingredient that his primary line has ample familiarity with: incense. And while Incense Flash's woods-and-incense motif seems to cover some familiar ground, we're pleased to report that this earthy, leathery, compulsively sniffable scent walks a deft line between comfortable and creative, with ample appeal for lovers of Andy's previous incense work and newcomers alike. As would befit a fragrance named Incense Flash, the incense buzzes from the very first spray, dry enough to bring out the natural earthiness of the Boswellia Serrata incense used, but supplemented with a subtly musky, woodsy sharpness- dare we say a hint of the famous Tauer signature? As Incense Flash dries, the incense lingers, now paired against a wonderfully evocative leather- rough and dusty, yet as it dries increasingly supple and smooth. What now lasts for hours is a new reference for incense scents, less forest, painter's studio or bazaar and more starlit, high desert vista. Distinct, compelling and easy to wear, Incense Flash is at once uniquely an Andy Tauer creation- and also something altogether new."," Leather, musky woods, ambergris, incense",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/69202.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, leather
Halfeti Eau de Parfum,Penhaligons," Sumptuous and mysterious, lush and spicy, Halfeti builds on the promise of the previous entries in Penhaligon's Trade Routes series by delivering an exotic and beautiful rose fragrance that sings with the luxuries of the 19th century's most rare and valuable trading commodities. Named for the gorgeous and exceedingly rare black roses found along the Euphrates river in Turkey, Halfeti takes this rose note- luscious, lightly fruity, fresh and rich- and sets it amongst notes of juicy, sharp grapefruit, fresh green vegetation, and a mouthwatering melange of culinary spices anchored with golden, redolent saffron. As the rose increases in intensity, joined by lightly indolic jasmine and fresh lily, a rich, regal base of leather, oud, patchouli and precious woods lends sophisticated depth, calling to mind a merchant ship returning to port, overflowing with priceless goods. Such is the balance of this exquisite fragrance that spicy and soft, lovely and dark, complex and comfortable all blend in perfect harmony, with that singularly beautiful rose standing tall in the middle. Rose fragrances come and go, but a treasure like Halfeti is a rare find indeed."," Grapefruit, bergamot, green notes, armoise, lavender, cardamom, cumin, nutmeg, saffron, violet, cinnamon, rose, jasmine, cypress, muguet, leather, oud, amber, resins, cedar, patchouli, tonka, vanilla, sandalwood, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/441010.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, grapefruit
Venetian Bergamot Eau de Parfum,TOM FORD Private Blend," Bergamot- fresh, fruity, spicy and complex- is perhaps the most unsung hero of perfumery of all styles and histories. Without bergamot, eaux de cologne lose their snappy freshness, fougeres forego their bracing sharpness, and chypres fall into flat, heavy dullness. It's therefore only appropriate that Tom Ford's new Venetian Bergamot, a modern-facing blend of these renowned styles of fragrance, keeps the noble bergamot front and center, sweeping us off our feet with the versatility and vibrancy of Italian bergamot carefully supported in a lush, fresh, spicy blend of woods and florals that refreshes and intoxicates all at once. Delicately creamy magnolia and sweet, fleshy gardenia and ylang ylang embrace smooth, robust cedarwood and cashmeran, while a sweet/spicy duo of black and pink pepper dance above the ground, each aspect enforcing and complimenting an aspect of the exquisite bergamot oil at the top of it all. Tom Ford has given fragrance's hardest working ingredient its very own feature- and we couldn't be happier."," Bergamot, black pepper, pink pepper, ginger, ylang ylang, gardenia, cedar, pepperwood, magnolia, sandalwood, tonka bean, amber, cashmeran.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/63541.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
La Vierge de Fer Eau de Parfum,Serge Lutens," Serge Lutens has a history of playful names that subtly subvert the fragrances they're attached to,   but naming a lush,   gentle lily after a medieval torture device might take the cake. ""La Vierge de Fer,  "" after all,   translates to ""the iron maiden,  "" that infamous spiked coffin more associated with heavy metal than French fragrance. But as always,   there's a method to the madness,   with La Vierge revealing itself to be a beautiful lily-led white floral whose sparkling aldehydic opening and lightly metallic incense base suggest the maiden's deadly spikes with a wink and a smile.La Vierge de Fer opens,   as we mentioned,   with a bright dose of aldehydes,   charging the concoction with tingling energy and subtle sweetness. As the floral heart warms,   jasmine brings the luscious fullness,   while lily provides the edges,   fresh,   green and yes,   lightly metallic. This last,   thematically appropriate element is further reinforced with the incense base,   while the musk accentuates the sweetness that also carries throughout the life of this fragrance. Sure,   we can see the subtleties that must have put a smile on the Serge Lutens team's faces when they chose to name this fragrance after the iron maiden. But to us,   this gorgeous,   sophisticated,   easy to wear floral is the opposite of torture."," Aldehydes, lily, jasmine, incense, white musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36153.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, aldehydes
Essence de Patchouli Eau de Parfum,Perris Monte Carlo," One of the most important ingredients available to a perfumer, patchouli was used historically by silk and cashmere traders to perfume precious textiles for their wealthy European customers. This practice popularized the scent, spreading the woody, leafy, naturally powerful aroma across the globe. Essence de Patchouli uses natural Patchouli essential oil, harmonized in the heart by the richness and the sensuality of rose and geranium, and made sophisticated in the base by an oriental/woody touch through the blend of labdanum absolute, vanilla, iris, cashmeran and precious woods. The result is a sophisticated chypre/oriental blend; it is rich, warm, and dry, but also breathtakingly soft."," Rose, geranium, orris, cedar, guaiac, patchouli, musk, labdanum absolute, coumarin, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70201.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, rose
Bois d'Oud Eau de Parfum,Perris Monte Carlo," A renowned Arab Caliph once saidIf I were a merchant, I would only trade in oud perfume, so that if I did not make a profit, I would have profited from its sensational scent.Bois d'Oud is a fresh, spicy and stunning fragrance that uses rich spices and ripe fruits to bring out oud's natural oriental and spicy characteristics. A fresh, vivifying top note of bergamot evolves towards a sensual heart of delicate flowers and sun-kissed fruits. The captivating wooden trail is enriched by vanilla and musky notes. Throughout it all, the oud sings, rich, sweet and resinous. Bois d'Oud proves that ""sophisticated"" and ""joyful"" need not be mutually exclusive."," Bergamot, fruity peach, plum, jasmine, rose, orris, orange blossom, oud, cedar wood, blackwood, patchouli, vanilla, amber, labdanum, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70203.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Oud Imperial Eau de Parfum,Perris Monte Carlo," Oud is one of the most precious natural essential oils available today. Its composition evokes different facets: woody, animalic, sensual and sophisticated. It has the power to give richness to compositions, and for this reason it is blended with other notes in order to create a more robust, versatile perfume.In Oud Imperial, this prized ingredient is mixed with other precious woody notes like Atlas cedar, vetiver from Java, and sandalwood to emphasize the natural woody and leathery characteristic of this beautiful formula. A rich and luxurious composition, Oud Imperial is an ideal fragrance for anyone of uncommon power and dignity."," Jasmine, cumin, incense, patchouli, saffron, oud, sandalwood, blackwood, cistus, vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70204.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, jasmine
Rose de Taif Eau de Parfum,Perris Monte Carlo," The Saudi Arabian city of TaÃ¯f has a glorious history, rich culture, and a unique geographic position, climate and fertile soil that have transformed it into a beautiful garden paradise. Here, the roses are more powerful, fresh, and possess a very sophisticated fragrance- the TaÃ¯f Rose oil is considered the best in the Arab world, the only place where it has been available- until today.Perris Monte Carlo has built Rose de TaÃ¯f with the objective to treat the centrepiece ingredient as a precious diamond. Like a diamond needs a gold ring to be presented, they have given the Rose of Taif a central position in harmony with other raw materials- light citrus, delicate spice, and supporting rose notes- that are able to highlight her beauty without any silhouettes. This is one of a kind, gorgeously lush rose, one that simply must be experienced by fragrance lovers of all persuasions."," Lemon, nutmeg, geranium, TaÃ¯f rose essential oil, rose Damas absolute, rose musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70205.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, lemon
Patchouli Nosy Be Eau de Parfum,Perris Monte Carlo," Nosy Be (or Nossi-BÃ©) is an island off the northwest coast of Madagascar, commonly known as the ""scented island"" due to the abundance of extremely high-quality perfume materials grown on its northern half. But patchouli, a sensitive and delicate plant to cultivate, has never been able to thrive in Nosy Be's intense heat. Until now. Perris Monte Carlo Patchouli Nosy Be contains the very first magical harvests of authentic Nosy Be patchouli, made possible through an innovative and painstaking process that involves transplanting developing plants by hand into shaded, protected areas amongst the ylang ylang plantations, which results in an extraordinary patchouli essential oil with unique dry, woody and cocoa-like properties. This precious material is then blended into a fragrance designed to showcase its uncharacteristic expansiveness- combined minimally with spicy pink pepper, smooth woods and a touch of warm resin, creamy vanilla and bitter cocoa. This allows the rare properties of this one-of-a-kind patchouli to sing, while keeping the overall composition uncomplicated enough that creative fragrance lovers can use it to add depth and exotic character in any number of layering combinations. Whether you're the world's biggest patchouli lover or you've never before been hooked, you owe it to yourself to try this extraordinary, breakthrough scent."," Pink pepper, Nosy Be patchouli, cedar, sandalwood, bitter cocoa, labdanum, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70206.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, pink pepper
Oud Alif Fragrance ConcentrÃ©e,Shay & Blue," What does it take in this era of all-oud-everything to make a distinctive, modern, head-turning oud? In the case of Oud Alif, the answer is dark chocolate- a jet-black, sumptuously rich note that blends into the extraordinary real oud extract- smoky, creamy and nuanced.  An elegant leather binds everything together, while savory saffron and an almost gourmand patchouli keep the mouthwatering deliciousness that many Shay & Blue fragrances are known for. Creamy and soft, smoky and rich, mysterious and sophisticated- Oud Alif is not just another oud fragrance.

Safanad Eau de Parfum,Parfums de Marly," The grace of a thoroughbred lies not only in its sheer power but also the stunning economy of that power- the perfection of each movement, the efficiency of every step. Safanad, with its delicate, subtly complex floral warmth, is a reflection of this grace, taking advantage of a quieter, more restrained composition to truly showcase each note and impress on us a form of beauty all the more ravishing for its dignity. Opening with bright orange and a lusciously three-dimensional pear note, Safanad then stuns us with a floral heart led by sweet ylang and lightly earthy iris. A warm, rich base of vanilla, woods and amber cradles these florals, keeping a fresh femininity to the composition throughout its life. Lush and gorgeous, Safanad is proof that gentle and stunning are not mutually exclusive terms."," Orange, pear, orange blossom, orris, ylang, amber, sandalwood, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70013.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, orange
Pegasus Eau de Parfum,Parfums de Marly," Pegasus- the horse God, the heavenly stallion portrayed in Coustou's famed statue. A creature of such power, refinement and nobility that only a God himself would dare attempt to ride him. In this spirit, Parfums de Marly's Pegasus is, itself, fragrance nobility- a skillfully refined take on the fougere style featuring unexpected notes of almond and vanilla that give it unique lasting power and striking dignity. Pegasus opens with the aforementioned almond note- lightly sweet, somewhat bitter, and warm, given juicy heft by a more traditionally fougere-like bergamot. The heart of the fragrance further expands on the almonds' sweet, marzipan-like depth, while an unlisted floral accord (lavender and jasmine?)exudes gentle, refined masculinity. In the base, vanilla is the clear star of the show, replacing a traditional fougere's mossiness with creamy warmth supplemented by amber notes, while a light, sharp sandalwood keeps everything airy enough to still earn the genre. To read the notes of Pegasus is to wonder how it earns a categorization as a men's fougere- to smell it, on the other hand, is to be so swept up in its sophistication and majesty that you've no choice but to understand."," Bergamot, heliotrope, spice, almond, amber, vanilla, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70005.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Cedrat Boise Eau de Parfum,Mancera," Fresh, fruity and yet utterly masculine, Cedrat Boise has received a steady buzz of excitement amongst fragrance aficionados since its release, not least for a purported resemblance to a certain holy grail fruity men's scent with a bit of a more expensive pedigree. And while we see several key differences between the two, what can't be denied is that Cedrat Boise is the equal to any casual-yet-sophisticated masculine on the market. Opening with a bright, zesty burst of blackcurrant and citrus, Cedrat Boise quickly layers on a sexy heart of jasmine and patchouli underneath the still-lingering fruity freshness, staying crisp for hours before slowly easing into a sumptuous drydown of cedar, sandalwood, leather and musky mosses. Gorgeously blended and all-season appropriate, Cedrat Boise is a remarkably versatile and enjoyable masculine- the one to reach for when you can only reach for one."," Bergamot, lemon, blackcurrant, cold spices, fruit basket, aquatic jasmine, patchouli, sandalwood, cedar, leather, moss, white musk, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64923.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Wild Rose Aoud Eau de Parfum,Mancera," Yes, we've all tried a rose and oud scent before. But when it's done as well as Wild Rose Aoud, it feels brand new all over again. Featuring a sparkling bergamot and lemon opening and a rich heart of exquisite Turkish rose to go with a deep, resinous oud base, Wild Rose Aoud isn't reinventing the style so much as perfecting it. Casual enough to wear every day, but captivating enough for the special moments in life, Wild Rose Aoud exudes an effortless beauty that will steal your heart."," Bergamot, lemon, rose, jasmine, patchouli, amber, musk, sandalwood, oud, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64909.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Fiero Eau de Parfum,Xerjoff - Casamorati," What makes a masculine fragrance old-school: ingredients, strength or style? In the case of Fiero, it's all of the above- a powerhouse of citrus, neroli, vetiver and spices with a classic fougere-style sensibility that's as captivatingly seductive as it is intense. Opening with bright, tart lemon, Fiero quickly starts rounding out its profile with the development of clean, full-bodied neroli, adding a green freshness. As the scent drys further, a dizzying array of spices and spiced ingredients come to the fore: rich, smoky vetiver, sharply bitter tarragon, and soapy, musky freshness that all combine to radiate classic, extremely sexy confidence. Signature scents can't leave much more of a signature than this one."," Bergamot, calabrian lemon, lemongrass, blood orange, thyme, lavender flowers, estragon, mint, neroli, nutmeg, mysore sandalwood, patchouli, vetiver, coumarin",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/67408.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
1861 - Zefiro Eau de Parfum,Xerjoff," Rome- the eternal city, a bustling modern metropolis with thousands of years of history beating in its heart and etched into its streets. Zefiro pays homage to Rome's baroque alchemy, a fragrance with both the instant appeal and the grand mystery of such a prestigious capital, suggestive and elusive, vibrant and unknowable. Zefiro opens with the lavish giddiness of il dolce far niente, a long weekend of fine wine and rich fruits. Cardamom and cinnamon evoke both mouthwatering cuisine and the well-spiced bustle of Rome's never-ending crowds, while iris and carnation represent beauty in all forms, from the perpetual spring season to the fashionable beauties in every square and nightclub. But Rome is also a city of history, and as Zefiro dries down, a rich amber and smoky incense remind us that around every corner is another masterpiece-stuffed museum, extravagant palazzo, or Imperial stronghold. And yet, a sweet, pervasive honey holds the earlier notes in place as well- after all, Rome isn't a city that changes, but a city where ancient and modern take root together in a hypnotic whirl."," Bergamot, Wine, Resins, Davana, Cardamom, Carnation, Cinnamon, Iris, Honey, Frankincense, Agarwood, Ambergris",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/51140.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
1861 - Naxos Eau de Parfum,Xerjoff," The most passionate and sensual area of a country that has never lacked for either, Sicily is a land of tradition and emotion, a rich Mediterranean island where nature and ancient history flow through every village and hillside. Naxos celebrates Sicily's deep and sensual heart with a rich, spicy, vital perfume, imbued with tradition but striving towards the contemporary. Naxos opens with a joyous vitality, juicy citrus notes of bergamot and lemon blending smoothly with mellow lavender and jasmine, enhanced by a sharp and audacious contrast of precious spices. As a rich drydown of tobacco leaf, tonka and vanilla berries emerges, the classical, light and fruity top notes flow into something more passionate and exotic, evoking the fierce spirit of Sicilians past and present. Beautiful and wild, both ferocious and gentle, Naxos is the essence of a a place that has always been and will always be."," Bergamot, Lemon, Lavender, Jasmine, Cinnamon, Honey, Cashmeran, Tobacco, Tonka Bean, Vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/51141.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Cio Cio San Eau de Parfum,Parfums MDCI," Picture a stage set with paper lanterns and parasols, the rustling of silk kimonos, and trees bursting with cherry blossoms  the heightened, glowing version of a far-off place that you might see at the opera. Here you will find the endearing and ever-hopeful Cio Cio San, whom you might know better as Madame Butterfly. Forget, for a moment, her tragic ending and think instead of the heroine who lives in a happy bubble of memory, a confection of young love and nostalgia that is as lovely and fragile as her namesake. This scent evokes Cio Cio San's happiest days, opening with an exhilarating splash of yuzu, limette and ginger that is joined by a profusion of flowers. The first impression is that of walking into a garden in full bloom, but the heady peonies and cherry blossoms quickly become light and sheer as the exquisite sweetness at the heart of the fragrance appears. Lychee is an incredibly distinctive note that blends delectable juicy fruit with a soft, rose-like quality--it is both instantly familiar and impossible to place, like a candy eaten in a dream. A watercolor wash of oolong tea adds to this wistful nostalgia, creating an ethereal finish that is both clean and vibrant. Like a haiku that can conjure up an entire scene with a few well-chosen details, Cio Cio San is a serene meditation that evokes the springtime and romance of old Japan with heart-twisting clarity."," Yuzu, limette, lemon, ginger, grapefruit, cherry blossom, peony, lychee, oolong tea, gaiac, cedarwood, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36518.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, yuzu
Orangea Eau de Parfum,Profumum," Naturalistic, fresh, and yet subtly sensual, Orangea is the smell of a modern Italian Garden of Eden, where young lovers intertwine beneath an orchard teeming with bitter oranges, a passionate embrace devoid of self-consciousness or shame.Opening with a brightly intense spritz of bergamot, Orangea quickly surrounds us in orange trees, a petitgrain-led burst of fresh, lightly bitter, subtly floral orange notes that at once refresh and excite. Crisp mint speaks of both innocence and sensual invigoration, while a light cedar drydown gives backbone. Passionate yet carefree, sensuous yet fresh, Orangea is a celebration of pure natural delight."," petitgrain, bergamot, mint, cedar leaves",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/33940.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, petitgrain
Grisette Eau de Parfum,Lubin," In the Belle Epoque, a grisette referred to the stylish young women employed in droves in Paris' booming sewing workshops. A fixture in the bars of Montmartre and the guinguettes on the Marne, the grisette was flirtatious, fun-loving, liberated, and full of the joie de vivre that inspired so much of the era's famed art and culture. Now as the newest fragrance from the venerable house of Lubin, Grisette is poised to capture the essence of these beautiful, industrious coquettes with a crisp, lush, spirited fragrance that you can hardly sniff without a smile. Grisette opens with bright citrus notes of grapefruit and bergamot, evoking the sun shining along the Seine as young roses- Moroccan and Bulgarian, presented as lovely and unpretentious as can be- wafts across the waters. Using for the first time an alcolate of rose concrete, Lubin has managed to preserve the most volatile and lively of the rose notes, which mingle with a touch of grapefruit to positively dance off the skin. Discreet heart notes of orris oil are cloaked in incense and hints of cedar wood with touches of musk and amber melt into the scent of Madagascan vanilla absolute. Joyful, playful and utterly gorgeous, Grisette is a fragrance for the spirit of youth within us all."," Citrus, grapefruit, bergamot, rose concrete, iris concrete, incense, musk, amber, cedar, Madagascan vanilla absolute.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/31221.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, citrus
Musc Extrait Extrait de Parfum,Bruno Acampora," Is the new Musc Extrait the perfect form for Bruno Acampora's widely beloved Musc? After all, while the classic oil is still renowned for its originality, depth and jaw-dropping longevity, and the Eau de Bruno spray is similarly worshipped for its versatility, sensuality and warmth, the Extrait encompasses all of this and more. Still steadfastly true to the deep, damp earthiness of the opening and the toe-curling pleasure of the richly comforting drydown that follows, Musc Extrait ups the ante with a satisfying floral sweetness that appears after the first spray and lingers through the gorgeous evolution that follows. It's everything you know and love about Bruno Musc- only even better.  ""The Extrait of perfume is the holistic expression of Acampora's collection. An ideal point of contact between the pure undiluted Essences (oils) and the classic Eau de Bruno (Eau de Parfum). Extraits are highly concentrated with fragrant oils and the purest aromatic ingredients."," Musk, rose, violet, jasmine, cloves, amber, patchouli, sandalwood.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/37534.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, musk
Five Eau de Parfum,Bruno Fazzolari," As the first of his perfumes to be featured in a gallery alongside his paintings, Bruno Fazzolari paired Five withvivid and lively paintings in primary colors... lit by strong fluorescent lights. One sniff of this brisk, crisply assertive citrus/herbal/woods fragrance and the association becomes clear. Five is almost a traditional cologne- bright, fresh, and vibrantly spiced- but like the otherworldly fluorescents casting their own character on a painting, there's something in the balance of the fragrance, and in the lightly mineralic touches, that forces one to see the whole thing slightly askew. Aromatic rosemary mingles with a heavy dose of petitgrain and a 'high altitude' accord to give a robustly ozonic characteristic, as if pure oxygen was pumping from Five's otherwise traditionally composed heart. Like the gallery lights set up to deliberately alter your perception of the painting, Five is the traditional cologne born anew."," Lemon, Red Mandarin, Bergamot, Neroli, Rosemary, Petitgrain, Sweet Woods, Mineral & Saltwater Notes",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/69302.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, lemon
La Religieuse Eau de Parfum,Serge Lutens," At turns delicate and animalic, pure and carnal, jasmine is rightfully considered one of perfumery's most versatile and valued notes.  Both reverent and blasphemous, La Religieuse (the nun) uses its jasmine to paint a portrait of a woman in full, where sweet and comforting give way to hidden depths of animalic desire, and ultimately, to freedom. La Religieuse opens with a gourmand flourish, as the fresh, lightly green jasmine combines with sweet, sugared mimosa and smooth incense to evoke imagery of a saintly servant of god, pure in her devotion and intentions, bringing comfort and joy to those under her care. But as it evolves, and a more animalic civet note begins to coax out the other side of the jasmine, we realize that this woman has her own desires, her own fantasies, and her own yearning to escape the life that has been given to her. While the sweetness lingers, the incense now feels dirtier, the musk sexier. La Religieuse never goes fully down and dirty, but the transition is thrillingly palpable: our heroine, while she might never go completely wild, is no longer content to be anyone's silent bride. Once again, Serge Lutens has delivered us a gorgeous, encompassing fragrance that tells a story we won't soon forget."," Jasmine, incense, civet.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36152.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, jasmine
Bal D'Afrique Roll-on Oil Perfume Oil,BYREDO," Bal d'Afrique is inspired by Paris in the late 1920's, when the city was infatuated with an idiosyncratic and fantastical vision of African culture, music and dance. Paris embraced the fabulous Josephine Baker as its muse and so does this enigmatic and playful scent.  Drawing on the euphoric mix of the avant-garde and exoticism that fueled the artistic life of the city, Jerome Epinette has created a fragrance with the exuberant sensuality of La Baker herself.  A vivacious blast of sunny citrus with just a pinch of spicy marigold makes a suitably dramatic entrance, leading to a brew of green bucchu, sheer and aqueous cyclamen and sweet violet. At center stage is the ever-bewitching vetiver, earthy and spicy, and smoothed with sweet amber and warm musk until it becomes velvety and almost edible. An extra soupÃ§on of growl is provided by cedar wood, but the overall effect is less voracious man-eating tiger and more of a mischievous tiger cub  sweet and adorable, but it still has claws.  Bal d'Afrique is warm and embracing with a purring, cozy quality that has us at its mercy. Be careful, this one is addictive."," Bergamot, lemon, neroli, african marigold, bucchu, violet, jasmin petals, cyclamen, black amber, musk, vetiver, moroccan cedarwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64166.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Gypsy Water Hair Perfume,BYREDO," BYREDO presents a hair perfume collection that invites you to care for and delicately scent the hair in one sensuous beautifying gesture. Enjoy the uplifting power of long lasting scents as they subtly diffuse throughout the day, amplified by the natural movement of the hair. Each hair perfume combines one of BYREDO's signature scents with a unique silicone and polymer formula to create a light, invisible veil designed to leave the hair nourished and luminous whilst divinely scented.This entrancing shape-shifter is one of the most popular fragrances in the Byredo line, and we can understand why. The opening is crisp and outdoorsy  strong, vibrant citrus, cool juniper and sharp pine needles. Floating incense and the sweet earthiness of orris help to set the scene: camping under an inky deep blue sky studded with brilliant stars, surrounded by pine trees, with a hint of smoke cutting through the chilly night air. As this wears on the skin, warm elements begin to flicker beneath the cool and sharp ones like the glowing embers of a campfire  golden amber, creamy vanilla and luscious sandalwood. A warm, soft, dreamy skin scent emerges, still with lovely cool traces of juniper, lemon and incense wafting over the top.  This has all the soft, amber coziness of a beloved cashmere sweater last worn to a bonfire on the winter solstice, with traces of smoke and pine and night air in its threads. It is the danger of a long wild night remembered from a warm and safe place. Richly evocative and absolutely gorgeous."," Bergamot, lemon, pepper, juniper berries, incense, pine needles, orris, amber, vanilla, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64168.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot

Kedu Eau de Parfum,MEMO," Kedu, nicknamedthe garden of Java in Indonesia, is a plain bordered by a volcano. Its soil, which has been made fertile by the ash, is sacred. Glossy green palm trees nonchalantly rub shoulders with one-horned rhinoceros, giant flowers in changing colours, prehistoric buffalo and bent-backed pilgrims.Tradition has it that you can purify your soul by throwing sesame seeds  one seed for each passion  into one of the flaming domes. By capturing this unique ingredient alongside a beautifully vibrant grapefruit note, Kedu whisks us away to one of the world's most unique locations.Kedu opens with that grapefruit essence, tart, juicy and bright, fleshed out further with supporting notes of citrus and matÃ©. Peppery green freesia explodes like the heat of the volcano, warming the sesame for a composition both floral and fresh but with a toasted complexity. If the holy site of Kedu represents purification, then the fragrance is the moments thereafter: light, bright, vibrant and free."," Grapefruit, neroli, mandarin, matÃ© absolute, freesia, rose, peony, sesame absolute, white musk, moss.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/69111.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, grapefruit
Luxor Oud,MEMO," The gateway of Luxor is humanity's oldest prayer site, a place where time stands still on the banks of the Nile. Under the shade of the colossus Ramses II, roses and fruits grow wild amongst the temple stones. Luxor Oud presents this majestic, mystical place in all of its balance between the ancient and the natural, freshness and sensuality vibrating in harmony with deep, resinous wood. Luxor Oud's balance comes from the classic marriage of rose and oud; in this case, a lush mixture of rose absolute given juicy fullness from essence of mandarin. Against this backdrop, the marvelous oud accord- robust and full-bodied with not a hint of medicinal artificiality- exudes quiet power.  By recreating the harmony of a sacred place claimed equally by nature and the gods, Luxor Oud is another beautifully transportive fragrance from MEMO Paris."," Mandarin, red berries, rose, cypriol heart, rockrose absolute, patchouli, styrax resin, tonka bean, oud.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/69107.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, mandarin
Irish Leather Eau de Parfum,MEMO,"It's one of those icy, biting mornings. The sun scarcely manages to break through the heavy grey clouds. The air is crisp and dry, and the wind slips beneath my clothes. The North wind whips the grass that sticks to my boots. I walk into the stable and swing open the wooden tack room doors, freeing the burning scent of leather, wood, amber and honey. Its age-old odor stands out sharply in the frozen morning air. My horse whinnies softly. It's the smell of her freedom. The leather gathers in the wind, the grass warms with the wood. Irish Leather gallops off into the horizon.MEMO co-founder John Molloy is understandably proud of his rural Irish upbringing, and Irish Leather, the first of MEMO's Cuirs Nomades series, positively sings of Ireland's rustic beauty. Opening notes of juniper, pink pepper and clary sage whisk us away to the wild countryside, while the leather- sharp, well-worn and deeply animalic- gives us the barn, the saddle and the horse all at once. Comforting yet forlorn, stark yet vibrantly beautiful, Irish Leather is among the most wonderfully wearable leathers we've ever experienced."," Pink pepper, clary sage, juniper berry, green matÃ© absolute, flouve, iris concrete, tonka bean absolute, leather, birch, amber accord.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/69108.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, pink pepper
French Leather Eau de Parfum,MEMO," The essence of French style lies not in wild extravagance or gauche flights of fantasy, but in the deceptively casual, elegant everyday fashion that exudes the wordly, confident sensuality that Parisians are known for. With French Leather, MEMO delivers a leather fragrance that feels quintessentially Parisian- luscious suede and elegant rose combining in a gently charming concoction made all the more irresistible by its everyday accessibility.   Like the effortless style of a true Parisian, French Leather accentuates the comfortable with the bold, in this case focusing on a butter-soft suede accord that comes to life with exquisitely rationed bursts of color- bright, vibrant lime, lively pink pepper and juniper, and rich, sensual rose. The result is sheer loveliness, the sort of lived-in elegance that projects comfort and confidence in equal measure. For the ingÃ©nue who never wants to be seen as trying too hard, French Leather is your new secret weapon."," Lime, pink pepper, juniper, rose, clary sage, cedar, styrax resin, vetiver, musk, suede accord.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/69110.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, lime
Debaser Eau de Parfum,D.S. and Durga," Blaring Pixies music on a hot day - that's the inspiration for D.S. and Duga's woody fig scent,  Debaser. For anyone who has heard Pixies' front man Black Francis' wail,  the thought of a fig scent may seem an odd choice. But Debaser,  named after the band's 1989 hit,  is not a typically creamy,  lactic or fruity fig. It's a bright,  hot green scent that opens with a waft of fig tree broiling in the August sun. It's an energetic,  warm,  bold and woody fig.Debaser's refrain,  ""I am un chien andalusia, "" is a nod to the title of Luis BuÃ±uel and Salvador DalÃ­'s classic surrealist film. Black Francis said of BuÃ±uel,  ""I wish BuÃ±uel were still alive. He made this film about nothing in particular. The title itself is a nonsense."" D.S. and Durga's Debaser is therefor a tribute to a song about a film about ""nothing in particular."" And fittingly,  it's a fragrance that becomes even more compelling in its drydown,  when it sheds the specificity of its figgy verisimilitude. That's when a perfect blend of base notes - iris,  coconut,  tonka and moss -  leave a cool,  velvet-soft hint of wood on skin. Earthy and addictive."," Bergamot, green leaf, pear stem, fig, coconut milk, iris, blond woods, tonka bean and moss.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/68600.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Egypt Eau de Toilette,Eight and Bob," Although Albert Fouquet is best remembered for creating Eight & Bob's distinct flagship scent (and captivating one John Fitzgerald Kennedy in the process), his olfactory adventures did not begin and end there. Egypt, one of two stunning new fragrances rediscovered from Fouquet's private collection, is a testament to Fouquet's enduring legacy, a subtle, sophisticated and remarkably fresh woody eau de parfum inspired by (and conceived during) two sightseeing trips through one of the world's most fascinating, culturally rich countries. Based on the exotic plants and flowers Fouquet found in the gardens of his Egyptian friend during his visit, Egypt opens with a crisp, understated mixture of citrus, lavender and moss, calling to mind leisurely mornings in sunny courtyards with good company. The heart of the fragrance is rich with Egyptian spices- cardamom and nutmeg- and a quietly robust base of leather, patchouli and sandalwood confers regal elegance without ever overpowering. Subtle yet vibrant, spicy yet soft, Egypt is the perfect fragrance for the worldly gentleman who knows when less is more."," Lavender, Moss, Lemon, Cardamom, Nutmeg, Sandalwood, Patchouli, Leather",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/63902.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, lavender
Cap d'Antibes Eau de Parfum,Eight and Bob," Sailing in the picturesque waters of the Grande Bleue, taking in a golden sunset from the gardens of the Eden Roc, enjoying a cocktail in the refined company of European aristocracy: summer on the French Riviera in the 1930s was the kind of glamorous existence that simply has no equal in contemporary society. For Albert Fouquet, it was the very pinnacle of life, one he was inspired to capture in a fragrance that might help chase away the doldrums of the cold Parisian winter. The resulting fragrance was Cap D'Antibes, an enveloping, sophisticated fougÃ¨re that was exclusive to Fouquet's private collection- until now. Cap D'Antibes immediately whisks you to the sun-kissed cobblestones of the south of France with a bright, sparkling opening of sweet violet, cool mint, and lightly resinous birch. The heart of the fragrance further invigorates, with cinnamon, moss, and a regional aromatic accord evoke fresh evening breezes and elegant cocktail parties. In the drydown, warm incense and delicate cedar intertwine with a perfect touch of relaxing vanilla. We may never see a time and place that can quite equal the glamour of Albert Fouquet's beloved Antibes. Luckily, he left us a perfect way to pay it a visit, wherever we may be."," mint, violet leaf, birch, cinnamon, moss, green notes, cedar, incense and vanilla.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/63903.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, mint
Swan Princess Eau de Parfum,The Vagabond Prince," As the old European fairy tale goes, a princess was turned into a beautiful white swan so resplendent in her plumage that anyone who touched her feathers was compelled to follow her wherever she went. Built around a lavish cocoon of six beautifully distinct musks, Swan Princess proves itself worthy of its namesake, delivering an enchantingly soft musky-floral that instantly puts you under its spell. As if first seeing the titular Swan from a distance, your first impressions of Swan Princess are sheer whiteness- sparkling clean aldehydes and crisp, fresh citrus, with only the tiniest zing of pink pepper for contrast. As the softness of the indulgently muscenone-laden base begins to emerge, it gently twists around a lusciously floral heart, led by notes of iris, rose and jasmine. The result is extraordinary- fresh, utterly natural flowers that float seamlessly into one another, every possible rough edge polished smooth by the gorgeous musk blend. Breathtakingly soft, achingly beautiful- Swan Princess is pure magic."," Pink pepper, aldehydes, fresh citrus accord, bergamot, jasmine, a touch of gardenia, lily of the valley, mimosa, iris, rose, peony, six different musks, sandalwood, vetiver.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/60002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, pink pepper
Heliotrope Eau de Parfum,Oriza L. Legrand," In the last 100 or so years, the heliotrope has been selectively bred to maximize its striking purple color, often sadly at the expense of its powerful, distinctive scent. How fortunate, therefore, that Heliotrope Blanc, created in 1886, honors the history of the flower by keeping the gorgeous vanilla-and-almond characteristics of heliotrope front and center. As a result, Heliotrope Blanc isn't just a fresh, elegantly blended floral with light gourmand touches- like all Oriza L. Legrand masterpieces, it's also a trip back through history. An exquisitely rich heliotrope permeates every level of this beautiful scent, opening alongside crisp violet leaves and orange blossom. In the heart, almond and mimosa draw out the heliotrope's indulgent side, drawing out the gourmand aspects of the flower while a sparkling iris keeps everything light and sheer. As Heliotrope Blanc dries down, musk and powder elements radiate softly, projecting timeless elegance. Not every heliotrope flower may smell as wonderfully as they used to, but as long as Oriza L. Legrand is around, we're happy knowing we can still get a gorgeous dose of the past."," Orange blossom, heliotrope, violet leaves, almond, mimosa, iris, musk, rice powder, benzoin, tonka bean.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/65227.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, orange blossom
Lys Noir Eau de Parfum,Isabey," The original edition of Lys Noir made its debut in 1924, the height of the glamorous anÃ©es folles, where its mysterious elegance and chic art deco design elements made it an instant hit among the fearless, trendsetting women that came to define the era. Now, 90 years later, the house of Isabey is again on the rise, and to celebrate the onset of their 10th decade, Lys Noir has been resurrected and updated for the modern market. We are delighted to confirm that this seductive, opulent woody floral fragrance is as perfect for the sophisticated femme fatale of today as it would have been all those years ago.As the name suggests, Lys Noir is built around the captivating, narcotic flower of the lily, which is accompanied at the opening with an invigoratingly spicy burst of black pepper. As the rest of the heady, deeply floral bouquet emerges- animalic tuberose, spicy narcissus- Lys Noir envelops us completely, drawing us further and further under its spell not with raw volume but with the sophistication and seductive appeal of its composition.

Doe in the Snow Eau de Parfum,4160 Tuesdays," The beauty of Sarah McCartney's playful, inventive creations lies in the specificity by which they're often created- inspired as she is by unique people, stories and requests, her scents are often more than a little out there- but they're never boring. Doe in the Snow, created for a customer's wintertime wedding, had a seemingly conflicting mission statement- make a big, fruity, mossy 60s/70s-style chypre, but make it cold.' The results are striking- citrus fruits, flowers and woods, stirred with an icicle. There's plenty of brightness from the grapefruit, yuzu and cedrat, but the cool, mossy leather notes and the sparkle of the aldehydes give a crisp chilliness to the light that feels like the sun rising across a frozen lake. Do you love the profile of big, vintage fragrances, but are uncomfortable with the idea of your scent entering the room before you do? Doe in the Snow lets you have it both ways. Graceful, yet practical, it's the casually opulent scent you never realized you needed."," Grapefruit, cedrat, yuzu, peach aldehyde, snow, cedarwood, rose, jasmine, oak, opoponax, oakmoss, leather, green tea absolute.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64612.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, grapefruit
Tart's Knicker Drawer Eau de Parfum,4160 Tuesdays,"One day in the lab we were filtering six different fragrances at once. I tweeted,I'm about to get in the E3 bus smelling like a tart's boudoir. The replies came back,You should make it!I'd like to smell that oneCan I buy some? so the next day, I sat down and blended some versions of all six.It may have come to pass from an off-color joke, but as with most of Sarah McCartney's more spontaneous sources of inspiration, the end results more than justify the concept. Tart's Knicker Drawer, despite the name, is anything but overloaded- in fact, it presents the sophisticated, immaculately assembled feel of an elegant woman of the 1950s- fitted waist, hat, heels, perfect makeup, and full-bodied, expensive perfume.  In other words, while there's plenty of notes (as one might suspect from such a blend-intensive fragrance!), the result is both cohesive and surprisingly easy to wear. Indeed, Tart's Knicker Drawer wears its tongue-in-cheek moniker as a badge of pride, reveling in the thick cloud of big, powdery florals and spices and musky, rich base notes with a seductive confidence. If you're the type of person who can tell someone that you're wearing a fragrance named Tart's Knicker Drawer, then you're also the type who can pull off something this big, beautiful and fun."," Bergamot, orange, grapefruit, pink peppercorn, raspberry, rose, jasmine, sandalwood, cedarwood, violet, tuberose, gaiacwood, amber, musk, vanilla, benzoin, tobacco.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64613.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Red Hoba Eau de Parfum,Xerjoff," A fragrance doesn't necessarily have to be a gourmand in order to make you smell good enough to eat. That was our first thought after trying Red Hoba, a rich, exquisitely spiced addition to Xerjoff's Shooting Stars collection that blends intensely smoky notes with growling animalic ones, and yet arrives at a result both thrilling and, yes, mouthwatering. Like a meal with a groundbreaking Michelin-starred chef, you may not understand how the flavors come together when you're reading the menu, but you certainly will once you try the results. Red Hoba opens with an almost-Christmas-y cinnamon and cardamom that dance on the skin and balance the floral and fruity nuances of a full-bodied bergamot. Warm orris, jasmine and patchouli swirl in harmony with gentle incense, but as the base emerges, a fiercely sexy mix of labdanum and castoreum mingle with a soft, comforting musk and a delicate gaiac wood. What category does Red Hoba fall into? One sniff, and we promise you won't care."," Bergamot, cinnamon, cardamom, jasmine, orris, incense, patchouli, cashmeran, guaiac wood, labdanum, papyrus, musk and castoreum.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/51138.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Blue Hope Eau de Parfum,Xerjoff," Conventional wisdom says that cool fragrances can't be passionate and gourmands must be sickly sweet. We're glad nobody told Xerjoff that, because Blue Hope, the newest Shooting Star, is a tantalizingly complex stunner that combines fresh citrus and delicate spices with a delectably sexy vanilla-based drydown. Blue Hope announces its year-round wearability with an opening blast of bright citrus, immediately given intriguing depth with a heart featuring rich, warm cedar and savory saffron. As the smooth, creamy vanilla of the base blends with the spices to create a mouthwatering mÃ©lange, an equally captivating castoreum/musk blend also asserts itself, balancing the delectable with the aphrodisiac. Finally, a fragrance guaranteed to make you smell delicious- in every way."," Bergamot, mandarin orange, saffron, cedar, jasmine, vanilla, castoreum and musk.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/51139.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Hedonist Rose Eau de Parfum,Viktoria Minya," Viktoria Minya possesses an undeniable talent for flirty, gorgeous florals. Her Hedonist Rose is a take of light airiness - a bouquet of fresh roses with a crisp white wine accord, like a chilled Sancerre with a hint of peach. Top notes of lemon and peach give way to a sultry base of clove, amber, musk and vanilla.Hedonist Rose is presented within a beautifully crafted bottle filled with hundreds of genuine bohemian crystals that sparkle brilliantly in the divine golden liquid. The bottle itself is enclosed within a handmade wooden box fashioned to capture the sleek look and feel of snakeskin leather."," Lemon, clove, peach, rose, amber, musk, vanilla, and a cold glass of wine.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/62401.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, lemon
Hedonist Iris Eau de Parfum,Viktoria Minya," Viktoria Minya's Hedonist Iris is a perfect balance of the chic and the sensual. An elegant iris heart is warmed with cocoa, blackcurrant, labdanum, and musk. The effect is a graceful drydown, as the cool cloud of the iris petals settle into the warmth of labdanum and cocoa. Creamy, comforting and addictive (like an expensive French-milled soap), this is a must try for any iris lover.Iris being the most expensive raw material of all, I knew I did not need to search further when searching for inspiration for the new Hedonists. I concentrated on the flower's delicate scent instead of the root, which is what most perfumers do. Hence the scent is powdery but much more refined, and it reflects better the majesty of Iris. Timeless elegance is what I felt being expressed whenever I worked on each trial, and often times I get feedback that it just smells like The Woman. The indulging note here is cocoa, but I didn't want it to be overwhelming, so it stays delicately in the background. Labdanum gives a certain depth to the fragrance, which I found particularly interesting, while the composition stays sheer and chic.""  Viktoria Minya Hedonist Iris is presented within a beautifully crafted bottle filled with hundreds of genuine bohemian crystals that sparkle brilliantly in the divine liquid and the bottle itself is enclosed within a handmade wooden box fashioned to capture the sleek look and feel of snakeskin leather.A Luckyscent exclusive!"," Bergamot, pink pepper, blackcurrant, iris, cedarwood, cocoa, labdanum, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/62402.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Eau de Hongrie Eau de Parfum,Viktoria Minya," Viktoria Minya's Eau de Hongrie is the revisitÃ© version of the famous Eau de la Reine de Hongrie (Water of the Queen of Hungary). The original Eau de la Reine de Hongrie was the first modern perfume referenced ever. According to the legend, the perfume was a gift from an angel and gave back youth and beauty to the aging Elisabeth in the 14th century, hence the Polish king fell in love and married her. In the 1300's the juice smelled pretty much smelled like rosemary tincture, so Minya decided to come up with a modern context of the famous scent. Today Hungary's famous Tokaji AszÃº ( Tokaji Essence ) represents a world wide appreciated dessert wine with proven medical benefits, this is why Eau de Hongrie evokes the honeyed aroma of this precious wine specialty.Lovers of gourmands and Tokaji Aszu alike will delight in the floating honey notes of Eau de Hongrie.  It is truly a bewitching elixir, capable of making one drunk just upon smelling.  Glittering citrus notes shape the opening of the scent, followed by smooth balsamic labdanum and immortelle.  A soft buzz of clove and a grounding sandalwood base finish it off, and all the time there is the glow of honey - warm and heavenly, as if it were dropped from the hands of an angel.It is represented in a unique wine-shaped bottle with the black textured wooden box."," Lemon, grapefruit, clove, jasmine, honey, sandalwood, immortelle, labdanum, musk, tonka bean and Tokaji Aszu wine.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/62403.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, lemon

Russian Tea Eau de Parfum,Masque Milano," Out there, the snow-covered Nevsky Prospekt, and a sumptuous Art Noveau building. Inside, a large bookstore. And, on the first floor, an elegant cafÃ¨. As water is poured in the cup, the infusion unleashes its most characteristic notes. Black tea, heavy and intense. A floral note, sharp and biting. And that unmistakably dry and smoky aftertaste given by the caravanserai campfires, meant to keep the precious tea cargo dry in the never-ending journey through Siberia. The fresh mint leaves give a pleasant fresh touch to the hot water. A teaspoon of raspberry preserve sweetens, without altering it, the bitter aftertaste of leather and birch. We sip it slowly, gazing out of the wide window, towards the beautiful cathedral of Our Lady of Kazan and beyond. The Russian Tea Ritual today carried us to an unexpected journey in remote lands, full of mystery and fascination.Russian Tea is a journey, a day spent in Russia with a boiling Samovar, reigning in the house as the center of socialization and sharing. The black tea smell is strong, diffusing all around the house. It also evokes the journey of the tea through Siberia, taking the smell of campfires, and transportation in harsh conditions, interpreted by woody and leathery notes. The fresh mint leaves blend incredibly well with the smokiness, and the hint of raspberry and cinnamon that sweeten the bitterness of the tea.  Julien Rasquinet, perfumer"," Mint, black pepper, raspberry, black tea, magnolia, everlasting flower, leather accord, incense, birchwood, cistus-labdanum.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64004.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, mint

L'Orpheline Eau de Parfum - ...,Serge Lutens," Serge Lutens wants to explore the mysterious places between the moon and the earth through contrasting elements of black, white, silver, and plush cream. His new L'orpheline begins with the night sky, pitch black from smoky incense, then pierced by the silver light of the moon's sparkling aldehydes. Billowing clouds of myrrh add to the impression of crystal clear brightness, but they are also cool in the style of an Avignon incense fragrance. The incense and aldehydes swirl, dance, and weave their way down to earth where they settle on a pillow of cashmere woods and delicately spiced warmth. Very quickly, L'orpheline transforms itself into the most addictive blend of smoky, woody cream. Clean musk, amber, and a hint of spices dust the soft woods, but the fleecy softness outweighs them all.

Oeillet Louis XV Eau de Parfum,Oriza L. Legrand," Powdery and peppery, silky and spicy, Oeillet Louis XV soothes yet confuses with its paradoxes. Reminiscent of an ancient time, powder fades and gives way to spicy notes of clove. Oeillet Louis XV is homage to the beloved French King Louis XV who saw Oriza's birth and became its most illustrious customer. White carnation is at the heart of this fragrance and is the source of its dichotomy. A symbol of true love under the monarchy, the flower embodied the fire of the French Revolution. As a scent, white carnation is as intoxicating as the most subtle poison; a delicate blend of mandarin, monarchical iris and light wood chords, which cannot resist the violence of pepper and spicy clove.

Deja le Printemps Eau de Parfum,Oriza L. Legrand," A promenade in Nature, awakening after a long winter sleep. Beads of morning dew glisten on clovers and wild grass, which exhale fresh and green scents. The sun rises on the horizon and beats down wet flowers and new born fig leaves. Fresh foliage scrunches under the wind, buds bloom at last and the soil smells of turf and twisted roots. Daisies in the prairie and lily of the valley blossoming on moss fill the air with the perfumes of nature's revival. At last spring has come."," Mint, orange blossom, daisy, fig leaves, clover, grass cutting, lily of the valley, galbanum, musk, vetiver, cedar, moss.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/65216.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, mint
Jardins d'Armide Eau de Parfum,Oriza L. Legrand," Les Jardins d'Armide are a symbol of beauty, lush and beautiful, full of fragrant flowers and the rarest species. The beautiful gardens were long mythical, but the success of the Renaissance myth of Armida gave these imaginary incomparable gardens a new impetus. The Great Century in France did not escape the attraction of myths. There was a genuine passion for symbolism, illusions, and enchantments. Armide, an emblematic seventeenth century witch, was a woman of great beauty who knew the art of seduction. She best embodies the ambivalent powers of charm. She is inextricably tied to these extraordinary gardens, so much so that the term ""Gardens of Armida"" became a reference in fashion during the subsequent centuries. Throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the Gardens of Armida are incessantly referred to in music (Lully, Vivaldi, Handel, Haydn, Rossini ...), painting (Poussin, Van Dyck, Tiepolo, Fragonard ...) and literature. This myth began with another one, the myth of Tasso in the sixteenth century. In 1909, the prestigious Maison de Parfums Oriza L. Legrand presentedJardins d'Aramide to its elegant clientele, le tout-Paris, in its prestigious boutique 11 Place de la Madeleine.The perfume is a tribute to the legendary gardens and the women who have symbolized them throughout the ages. The Rose, Queen of Flowers, is at the heart of this enchanting bouquet picked in the Garden of Armida. Iris from Florence, wild violet powder, wisteria and carnations from India, whilst honey, almond and musk bring incomparable strength to this tempting elixir.Bottle comes as a splash with an atomizer spray included in the box."," Rose, orange blossom, iris powder, florentine Iris, wild violet, wisteria, carnation from India, honey, almond, tonka bean, musk.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/65217.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, rose
Roses Vanille Eau de Parfum,Mancera," When we call a fragrancebreathtaking,  do we really mean it? As in,  a sumptuous,  gorgeous,  flowery-creamy-musky indulgence that interrupts our very respiration as we dive greedily back in for a second sniff? With Roses Vanille,  we do. Sweet enough to capture us,  rich enough to keep us and complex enough to seduce us,  Roses Vanille is an absolute standout of the Mancera line and one of the sexiest floral gourmands we've ever smelled.

South Bay Eau de Toilette,The Different Company," Intensely sparkling, this eau de toilette  unveils a woody architecture behind its fresh head notes. The heart is based on the Grapefruit wood which brings backbone to the perfume. A touch of daim in the bottom notes splendidly underlines the Sandalwood.

Amber Oud Eau de Parfum,PARFUMS DE NICOLAI," Amber Oud embodies a golden effervescence, a freshness you wouldn't expect from its name.  Debuting with clean spice notes and a bubbly profile, the scent presents a generous herbal bouquet.  Wafts of lavender, thyme, sage, and artemisia  provide a stunning balance to the warm and rich notes lying deep within the scent.  The warmth of amber, vanilla, and patchouli anchors the scent but doesn't disrupt its clean and elegant persona.  Laced with saffron and a dash of cinnamon, Amber Oud is sure to surprise you with its intriguing blend of grace and mystery."," Lavender, Thyme, Sage, Cinnamon, Saffron, Agarwood, Cedar, Patchouli, Sandalwood, Vanilla, Tonka bean, Styrax, Musk, Castoreum, Amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/31347.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, lavender
Luci Ed Ombre Eau de Parfum,Masque Milano," You walk through a thick wood where only small beams of light can shine through.  The trees are heavy with moss and the soft and spicy scent of earth. Determined blooms of jasmine and tuberose fight for the sparse light that will keep them alive. A shiver runs down your back and you feel the humid breathe of a wolf down your neck.  An uneasiness directs you into a broad meadow where the blinding light makes you sneeze. You overturn a log: damp ground and creatures that haven't seen the sun in years. You no longer know where you are or where you long to be. The dark side is irresistibly fascinating, perhaps stronger than any fears and uneasiness it produces.Luci ed Ombre speaks to chiaroscuro, or the practice of using light and dark in painting for dramatic effect.  These opposites not only cohabit a space but also make one another more powerful.  The scent portrays both an energetic freshness and a dark animalic truth.  Notes of ginger and earthy patchouli balance indolic florals and a wisp of incense. A perfect scent for those seeking something truly mysterious and captivating."," Incense, Ginger, Tuberose, Jasmine, Moss, Cedarwood, Patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, incense
Bal d'Afrique Eau de Parfum,BYREDO," Bal d'Afrique is inspired by Paris in the late 1920's, when the city was infatuated with an idiosyncratic and fantastical vision of African culture, music and dance. Paris embraced the fabulous Josephine Baker as its muse and so does this enigmatic and playful scent.  Drawing on the euphoric mix of the avant-garde and exoticism that fueled the artistic life of the city, Jerome Epinette has created a fragrance with the exuberant sensuality of La Baker herself.  A vivacious blast of sunny citrus with just a pinch of spicy marigold makes a suitably dramatic entrance, leading to a brew of green bucchu, sheer and aqueous cyclamen and sweet violet. At center stage is the ever-bewitching vetiver, earthy and spicy, and smoothed with sweet amber and warm musk until it becomes velvety and almost edible. An extra soupÃ§on of growl is provided by cedar wood, but the overall effect is less voracious man-eating tiger and more of a mischievous tiger cub  sweet and adorable, but it still has claws.  Bal d'Afrique is warm and embracing with a purring, cozy quality that has us at its mercy. Be careful, this one is addictive."," Bergamot, lemon, neroli, african marigold, bucchu, violet, jasmin petals, cyclamen, black amber, musk, vetiver, moroccan cedarwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64105.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Pulp Eau de Parfum,BYREDO," Pulp is the epitome of ripe fruit, bottled. Imagine that you have just bitten into the juiciest, ripest plum, felt the snap of a crisp apple in your teeth, indulged in a handful of berries ready to explode, all fresh from the fields and orchards, the kiss of the sun still on them. Now put it all in your mouth at the same time and you have the cacophony of fruit that is Pulp. This is grown-up fruit: no sugar-coating, no syrup, just a tiny hint of sweetness to bring out the nuances.  With a whiff of blossom and a touch of bark, you can sense an olfactory arc of how the fruit begins, grows, and ripens. Pulp will make you smile and feel a bit giddy, because there is nothing else quite like it."," Bergamot, cardamom, black currant, fig, red apple, tiara, cedar wood, praline, peach flower",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64101.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Gypsy Water Eau de Parfum,BYREDO," This entrancing shape-shifter is one of the most popular fragrances in the Byredo line, and we can understand why. The opening is crisp and outdoorsy  strong, vibrant citrus, cool juniper and sharp pine needles. Floating incense and the sweet earthiness of orris help to set the scene: camping under an inky deep blue sky studded with brilliant stars, surrounded by pine trees, with a hint of smoke cutting through the chilly night air. As this wears on the skin, warm elements begin to flicker beneath the cool and sharp ones like the glowing embers of a campfire  golden amber, creamy vanilla and luscious sandalwood. A warm, soft, dreamy skin scent emerges, still with lovely cool traces of juniper, lemon and incense wafting over the top.  This has all the soft, amber coziness of a beloved cashmere sweater last worn to a bonfire on the winter solstice, with traces of smoke and pine and night air in its threads. It is the danger of a long wild night remembered from a warm and safe place. Richly evocative and absolutely gorgeous."," Bergamot, lemon, pepper, juniper berries, incense, pine needles, orris, amber, vanilla, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64103.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Rose Noir Eau de Parfum,BYREDO," Some roses are best smelled in the dark. Rose Noir takes the innocence of a fresh Damascene rose and tramples it underfoot.  The romance of the bed strewn with rose petals intensifies as the petals mingle with the decadent fragrances of sensuality.  You can languish in that aroma, made peppery by freesia, and darkened with earthy cistus, green moss, and animalic musk. Rose Noir is a contemporary rose, dirtied up and served with a nice dollop of sensuality."," Grapefruit, freesia, rose damascena, cistus, moss, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64104.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, grapefruit
Sunday Cologne Eau de Parfum,BYREDO," In the 18th century, the Italian perfume maker of the original Eau de Cologne, Giovanni Maria Farina, wrote to his brother that,I have found a fragrance that reminds me of an Italian spring morning, of mountain daffodils and orange blossoms after the rain.The essential qualities of eau de cologne, the lightest of all the perfume categories, with their fresh and casually elegant mix of citrus, floral, and herb oils, have remained intact throughout the centuries. This basic DNA of eau de cologne remains in Byredo's Sunday Cologne,  but with added body and depth, warmth and diffusion. Star anise and cardamom add a touch of olfactory heat and sweetness to Sunday Cologne. Meanwhile, incense adds a spicy bite; patchouli displays a rough, camphorous glow; moss and vetiver harmonize to add a touch of earthiness. Sunday Cologne perfectly balances crispness with warmth, convention with edge."," Bergamot, star anise, cardamom, geranium, incense, lavender, vetiver, moss, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64107.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Nuit Andalouse Eau de Parfum,Parfums MDCI," A dreamy white floral centered around gardenia, the queen of tropical flowers. Nuit Andalouse opens with a sweet, delicate violet that perfectly sets the stage for the euphoric gardenia ahead, like a flower girl dropping petals before the radiant bride steps down the aisle. A sparkling orange note appears, clear and bell-like, which then blends with heady orange blossom, soft creamy vanilla and the luminous gardenia to create a fragrance with the luscious, but airy, quality of a mousse or semifreddo   smooth and delicious, but never too heavy or rich. Created by CÃ©cile Zarokian, this lovely scent pulls off the difficult feat of balancing elegance and charm. It is as exquisitely feminine as the rustle of silk skirts and as light-hearted as a kiss blown in the wind. Rose and ylang ylang contribute to the lushness of the flowers and sensuous sandalwood and musk add cozy warmth. All of these elements are but supporting players to the gardenia, however  doing whatever is necessary to show off our sweet and glowing diva to her best effect. Romantic and lovely."," Orange, green notes, violet, gardenia, ylang ylang, rose, vanilla, sandalwood, musk, salicylates",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36516.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, orange
Eight and Bob Eau de Parfum,Eight and Bob," When American student John F. Kennedy met Parisian aristocrat Albert Fouquet on the Cotes d'Azur in the 1930s, not only was he charmed by the man, he was also intrigued by his hand-crafted scent. Upon his return to the US, JFK made a quirky request for eight samples and if your production allows, another one for Bob.EIGHT & BOB, as the cologne came to be known, was a hit with the Hollywood elite, but it would languish for decades after Albert's tragic death in a car crash. WWII forced Fouquet's loyal butler Philippe the only other person who knew the cologne's formula to hide his final shipment of bottles inside books that he carefully cut by hand.But EIGHT & BOB has returned. Based on its original formula, this bright, elegant cologne with the rareAndrea plant extract from the Andes. The Andrea species is a wild plant in short supply due to the altitude and limited area in which it grows, and can only be picked during the months of December and January. The plants gathered undergo a very exacting selection process in which only seven percent are chosen. This process ends between March and April and only then is it known how many units of EIGHT & BOB can be bottled for the year.A fragrance with a history, EIGHT & BOB is a true perfume event. The bottle is hidden in a book, just as it was long ago."," Citrus, spice accord, violet, iris, cedar, sandalwood, gaiac, ambergris",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/63901.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, citrus
Cuir Garamante Eau de Parfum,Parfums MDCI," Leather can be many things  stern military boots, a worn-in saddle, a comfy chair. Cuir Garamante is a leather jacket  thick but supple  worn by a mysterious man who travels the world for reasons he keeps to himself. Journalist? Jewel thief? Spy? This is a jacket that has been to spice bazaars and state dinners and secret parties. It has snuck into palaces and jumped out of planes and hidden in opium dens. The opening has a tantalizing spiciness swirled with a swoony, boozy sweetness. Rich saffron, delicious nutmeg and sultry rose pave the way for the luxurious leather that is the central player. Although this leather does have the creamy aspect we love, it also has simmering animalic sensuality. It's a little bit rough, a little bit dirty and deeply sexy. Oud-like incense and sharp papyrus heighten the edgier qualities, while vanilla and sandalwood add a luscious warmth and smoothness. Weaving in and out is labdanum  smoky, sweetly resinous and mesmerizing. Addictive and fiendishly attractive  this is an outstanding interpretation of leather, one of our favorite notes."," Pink pepper, nutmeg, saffron, rose, oud accord, papyrus, leather, vanilla, labdanum, incense, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36514.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, pink pepper
Black Eau de Toilette,Comme des Garcons: PLAY," What's black? Pepper, lapsang souchong tea, birch tar... even tree moss can bring a lacquered black vibe to a scent. Black Play leans towards the fougÃ¨re, but with an intriguing, salty twist that can almost be tasted, and a metallic, rosy undercurrent.  A very light powdery effect conjured by the tree moss and violet turns these dusky accords into the deep matte velvet of a black swallowtail wing. A little more on the masculine side, but then, women have been known to dabble."," Black pepper, pepperwood, red pepper, violet, thyme, black tea, birch tar, incense, tree moss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/58100.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, black pepper
Oud Wood Eau de Parfum,TOM FORD Private Blend," It was Tom Ford who pioneered the oud note in contemporary Western perfumery way back in 2002 during his tenure as the artistic director of Yves Saint Laurent, with the groundbreaking M7. In 2007, he was still one of the few to showcase it in his own Private Blends. Today, not only has Oud Wood become one of the brand's classics, but it has spawned the brand-newOud Collection, built around the original's core accord of oud, sandalwood and patchouli.Oud Wood's packaging may have changed, but fear not: you'll find the same powerful blend of cool spices and smoky woods, softened with a hint of vanilla and tonka bean. The daunting, medicinal and overly animalic facets of oud are toned down, translating the precious agarwood into a darkly elegant element of the perfumer's palette rather than a full-on French-Arabian extravaganza. As chic, urbane and sharply-cut as Mr. Ford's James Bond suits in Skyfall. And just as much of a sexy beast as Daniel Craig."," Oud, Chinese pepper, pink pepper, cardamom, birch tar, cistus, incense, sandalwood, vetiver, patchouli, cedarwood Atlas, vanilla, tonka bean Click Here For Ingredients ÃClose Oud Wood by TOM FORD Private Blend Ingredients Please be aware that ingredient lists may change or vary from time to time.

Tobacco Oud Eau de Parfum,TOM FORD Private Blend," It was Tom Ford who pioneered the oud note in contemporary Western perfumery way back in 2002 during his tenure as the artistic director of Yves Saint Laurent, with the groundbreaking M7. In 2007, he was still one of the few to showcase it in his own Private Blends with Oud Wood.Along with the latter and Oud Fleur, Tobacco Oud is part of the brand-newOud Collection.  And in case you were wondering, any resemblance with Tobacco Vanille  a firm favorite in the Private Blends  is most emphatically not coincidental, since Tobacco Oud was composed by the very same perfumer, Olivier Gillotin. Here, the vanilla is ousted by  obviously  oud. The tobacco accord is less of a mellow pipe tobacco though it retains the delectable almondy inflection of tonka. Instead, it was inspired bydokha, a traditionalblend of herbs, flowers and spice-laden tobacco. And a heady blend it is, matching the fragrant smokes of oud resin and aromatic tobacco, with none of the side effects...If you've been hankering for a darker, sultrier, woodier version of Tobacco Vanille, or like to tame your oud with a touch of sweetness, a whiff of this might turn your head: it's one of Mr. Ford's most addictive offerings to date."," Oud, tobacco dust absolute, coriander, cistus, labdanum, cedarwood, patchouli, sandalwood, roasted organic tonka bean, castoreum Click Here For Ingredients ÃClose Tobacco Oud by TOM FORD Private Blend Ingredients Please be aware that ingredient lists may change or vary from time to time.

Fate Man Eau de Parfum,Amouage," In the final creation that expresses the end of the first cycle of the Amouage narrative,Fate for man and woman explores the uncertainty of the future and the universal principal by which the order of things is inescapably prescribed. The immutable fragrances are presented in Amouage's iconic clear glass-crystal bottles with a rainbow undertone with gold plated caps accented with an aurora borealis inspired Swarovski crystal.Fate Man is one of those rare perfumes where you just have to try it to understand it. It begins with an opening salvo of absinthe and herbs through a heart of immortelle swathed in the most luxurious frankincense. The wheel of fortune that is Fate Man ends up on cedar and licorice to bring this stunning perfume to a close. Despite being labeled as masculine, Fate Man is a true shared fragrance and if you are a fan of Amouage-- this is a must try. Fate Man is as ever-changing as the swirling colors on the rainbow coated flacon; the experience is slightly altered every time you wear it."," Mandarin, saffron, absinth, ginger, cumin, everlasting flower, rose, frankincense, lavandin, cistus, copahu, labdanum, cedarwood, liquorice, tonka bean, sandalwood, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/41847.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, mandarin
Fate Woman,Amouage," Awarded 5 Stars (Masterpiece) by Luca TurinHow time flies. It seems only yesterday (actually five full years) that Christopher Chong took over Amouage's art direction and propelled this Omani firm, then known chiefly for its classic no-expense-spared Gold, into the first rank of perfumery. Chong is that rare bird, a natural perfumery art-director, who knows what he wants and will not give up until he finally smells it. In a recent interview with Style.com/Arabia, he said that Fate was a loud fragrance, so one expects a massively-built monster like the wonderful Ubar reissue in 2009. The surprise begins with the first puff from the spray: a fresh, radiant, powdery advance guard briefly fills the room. Seconds later, you are faced with one of the most intricate and beguiling fragrances in years. Nothing this big, complex and beautiful has been done since the first Boucheron. Though the top has a Guerlain-like appetizing feel, Fate borrows its core from Opium, i.e., woody-balsamic with an emphatic dose of the cool minty note that separates it from the merely warm, dusky Cabochard-Cinnabar style. Opium's virtue was its novel, instantly recognizable tune, of which we eventually tired. But don't let the reference put you off. Fate is to Opium what Mitsouko was to Coty's Chypre: a transfiguration. The central structure is deep in there, now cloaked in a cloud of radiant dust borrowed from the unstructured opulence of Gold, plusa brilliant toucha dry, fresh cigar-box cedar note to guard against excessive sweetness. Loud? Possibly, but comfortably so, without harshness or distortion. Like very few fragrances, Fate delivers the rush of physical glee you get when you sit in the front row of the stalls and a great orchestra begins to play. Just don't wear it to supper.  Luca Turin, Style.com/Arabia"," Bergamot, cinnamon, chilli, pepper, rose, narcissus, jasmine, frankincense, labdanum, vanilla bean, benzoin, castoreum, patchouli, oakmoss, leather.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/41848.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Kyoto Eau de Toilette,Comme des Garcons: Incense," For thousands of years, people around the world have burned incense to honor their ancestors, purify the air, worship deities, accompany rituals or merely for the pure enjoyment that incense brings. Kyoto is a spiritual journey to the serene temples of the city known as Heart of Japan. Dry and calm, the cedar note in Kyoto is evident, swirling with the earthy scents of spicy, smoky vetiver and the juniper-meets-evergreen aroma of cypress. Serene and earthbound, Kyoto's quiet power is never harsh; it's a meditative scent, bringing to mind relaxing in one of Kyoto's legendary rotenburo (outdoor hot spring baths) nestled among the legendary cypress trees."," incense, cypress oil, coffee, teak wood, vetiver, patchouli, amber, everlasting flower, Virginian cedar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/21901.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, incense
Jaisalmer Eau de Toilette,Comme des Garcons: Incense," Named after the ancient desert city in India, Jaisalmer was inspired by the spices and woods that passed through its namesake trade route, linking India to Egypt. Throughout the Incense series, CdG took at least one element associated with the city/country from which each of the scents take their name; in Jaisalmer, prized Indian ebony is added to resinous guaiac hardwood at the base, while a healthy dose of spice comprises the opening. The opposing sweet spice and earthy wood nature of this incense is a perfect salute to the gorgeous culture amidst the harsh climate of Jaisalmer itself."," cardamom, incense, cinnamon, amber, benzoin, pimento, berries, guaiac wood (aka gaiac wood or saint wood), ebony",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/21902.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, cardamom
Ouarzazate Eau de Toilette,Comme des Garcons: Incense," The high Atlas mountain city of Ouarzazate (pronounced war-za-zat) in Morocco was the inspiration of this masterpiece. At its opening, a sweet, balsamic tang of labdanum absolute quickly followed by zesty pepper tickles your nose. As it warms on the skin, the softly herbal clary sage (for which Morocco's is hailed as among the finest in the world) blends with a now-calm pepper and nutmeg to make Ouarzazate a crossroads of perfectly blended, spiced incense of the Middle Eastern variety. We close our eyes and imagine we're in the cool, still interior of Ouarzazate's famous Kasbah."," incense, pepper, nutmeg, clary sage, wenge, musk, vanilla, labdanum absolute, Kashmir wood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/21903.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, incense
Tabac Rouge Eau de Parfum,Phaedon," Turkish Blend is a quintessentially Art Deco composition. Turkish tobacco absolute and incense make up the core accord, spare, dry and perfectly balanced. As in Tamara de Lempicka's paintings, thecolor palette is pared-down and vibrant: ginger, cinnamon and a lick of honey. In the base notes, musks, bolstered by warm, powdery Siam benzoin, blend the scent with your skin. Androgynous, stylized and luxurious."," ginger, cinnamon, honey, musk, powdery notes and benzoin",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/56609.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, ginger
Violette Fumee,Mona di Orio,"With the creation of Violette FumÃ©e, Mona composed the melody of my favorite passions, memories and materials.With flirty florals like violet and rose fumed with pipe tobacco, the exquisite smoothness of cashmere and suede, and deep resinous undertones, this warmly smoldering scent evokes my sensorial love for luxury, and makes me feel, dream, travel and remember.Revved at the start, crisp, fresh notes of herbal lavender and sparkling bergamot pair with inky oakmoss and get a twist as the scent unfolds into the elegance of vetiver and clary sage.The shy violet and iconic rose develop into a powdery and gourmand fume and then ramp up as spicy and savory notes of aphrodisiac saffron and smoky bois de gaiac communicate with the florals and begin to ignite.The smoldering continues as resinous opoponax, myrrh, and musky cashmeran dive slowly into an intense velvety embrace.  Jeroen Oude Sogtoen, Partner & Creative Director for Maison Mona di Orio."," Lavender, Bergamot, Oakmoss, Violet flowers and leaves, Turkish Rose, Vetiver, Clary Sage, Opoponax, Myrrh, Cashmeran",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/51725.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, lavender
Jasmin Rouge Eau de Parfum,TOM FORD Private Blend," Jasmine is one of those perfume ingredients that can be played in many keys, depending on the pitch wanted  high, green and fresh, or low, indolic-dirty, and languid. Tom Ford's Jasmine Rouge/Private Label starts off like a fine glass of champagne, with a bubbly effervescence courtesy of an aldehyde-driven bergamot and mandarine. As it develops with piquante neroli, languid-to-tropical, waxy ylang-ylang, and warming, beguiling spices, Jasmine Rouge seems to explode into variations on jasmine's richness and lightness. Towards the end, balsamic notes of vanilla and amber combine with a subtle woodsy-leather accord to wrap sparkling jasmine in their warm embrace, like a leather jacket on top of delicate, bare shoulders."," Bergamot, mandarine, cardamom, jasmine, cinnamon, ginger, clary, neroli, ylang-ylang, vanilla, leather, amber, wood Click Here For Ingredients ÃClose Jasmin Rouge by TOM FORD Private Blend Ingredients Please be aware that ingredient lists may change or vary from time to time.

It opens with a luscious burst of neroli and layers of citrus notes, including bergamot, lemon and pittosporum, with its heady, jasmine-and-orange blossom-like bouquet. It then accents this bouquet with green and dusky herbs, including rosemary and lavender. This burst of freshness is warmed by an understated woody and amber base.

In Tom Ford's dark rose scent Noir de Noir, as the name suggests, black is indeed the name of the game. But once you adjust your eyes, the rose and its handmaidens glimmer like rich jewels glowing in the dark. This inky, goth, midnight rose is cloaked with mantles of oud, amber, and camphory patchouli. Saffron and truffle notes create a soft veil around this darkness, with a hint of vanilla, and tree moss adds a little more texture in the base.

But as they hit you, they're joined by mellow, even aged tobacco notes that add a dry elegance and club room gravitas to its subtle sweetness.

Tuscan Leather Eau de Parfum,TOM FORD Private Blend," In Tom Ford's Tuscan Leather, a smoky, bitter birch-tar leather accord combines with thyme, raspberry, and saffron to create a scent paradox: A perfume that's both clean and sultry, bone-dry and sweet. Although it remains a true leather scent through and through, Tuscan Leather shows its refined, softer side, by letting an herbal, fruity and sheer floral sweetness (night blooming jasmine) break its toughness like a leather jacket that gets softer and more supple with wear. A true unisex fragrance perfect for both day and nighttime."," Leather, olibanum, night blooming jasmine, and black suede Click Here For Ingredients ÃClose Tuscan Leather by TOM FORD Private Blend Ingredients Please be aware that ingredient lists may change or vary from time to time.

Aqua Vitae Eau de Toilette,Maison Francis Kurkdjian," It was one afternoon on Formentera, in the Balearic Islands, that the idea of Aqua Vitae came to my mind. Riding an old motorbike, taking it slowly in view of the extreme heat, the air on my face was deliciously cool. The sun intensified the fragrances of the nature around me. Aqua Vitae, the water of life, when life is quite simply beautiful, an extremely sensitive sensuality enveloped with an uncontained freshness.  Francis Kurkdjian Kurkdjian's gorgeous ode to a summer afternoon opens with a sparkling combination of Calabrian lemon and Sicilian mandarin, evoking the sensual fullness ofuncontained freshness.  Dazzling Hedione adds with the warmth of the sun while waves of tonka bean and vanilla counter with a cooling breeze.In its final phase, Aqua Vitae softens to a sunkissed, sandy drydown. By no means is it a fresh dab of coppertone - no beachy coconut here, but rather a whisper of vanilla-sweetened guaiac lingering close to the skin. It's a gentle reminder of summer afternoon caught on the skin, still warm from the sun."," Lemon, mandarin, tonka bean, vanilla infusion, hedione and guaiac wood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/49835.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, lemon
Classical Eau de Parfum,Anat Fritz," Inspired by Berlin designer Anat Fritz's youthful memories of sun-drenched weekends in the countryside, Classical has long been that rare fragrance that evokes a near-universal sense of childhood. Now, having been reworked by one of Germany's most renowned noses (we're not supposed to tell), Classical has upped the ante, taking an already bright and comforting scent and rounding it out into a luminously nostalgic Eau de Parfum meant to take each wearer on their own unique journey.Just as before, Classical features three essential main ingredients. Wild lavender is still the beating heart of the fragrance, underpinned with rich cedarwood and gentle vetiver to evoke images of lush forests and rolling meadows full of children at play. In Anat's new reformulation, however, the Lavender is toned down, and complemented with the addition of creamy sandalwood--adding a blast of air and light, smoothing the edges into a shimmering composition that perfectly captures the ethereal beauty of a childhood memory- no matter where you grew up."," Lavender, vetiver, cedar, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/35002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, lavender
Java Blossom Attar / perfume oil,Xerjoff - XJ Oud Attars," Java Blossom is by far the coolest and smoothest in the Xerjoff Oud Attars collection. It transports you to an ancient sanctuary in a sacred forest, where the oud has been around for centuries, and has seen everything there is to see. It has witnessed every flower blossom, and has chosen a clean soothing orange blossom along with a slightly smokey tuberose to compliment its unique timelessness. In this oud you won't find a dirty or salty note, just raw oud and a broad footprint of vetiver - earthy, green, and ancient."," Bergamot, Orange Blossom, Incense, Tuberose, Hindi Oud, Sandalwood, Vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/63400.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Black Sukar Attar / perfume oil,Xerjoff - XJ Oud Attars," Black Sukar is a truly unique take on oud, and the brightest and sweetest in the Xerjoff Oud Attars collection.  A juicy orange gives this oud scent a friendly presence, while slightly soapy freesia and peony lend an unexpected clean floral aspect to the blend.  The pink pepper and rose notes balance the slightly sugary quality of this scent, and while it may be light and sweet, the oud note is unmistakeable.  Black Sukar is perfect for an oud lover who wants to challenge the dark and dirty status quo."," Orange, Pink Pepper & Freesia, Damascus Rose, Peony, Vanilla, Laos Oud and White Musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/63401.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, orange
Warda al Oud Attar / perfume oil,Xerjoff - XJ Oud Attars," Warda Al Oud is not an oud scent for beginners, but it is remarkable one.  The floral notes in this scent deliver a heavy dose of indole, giving it a musky and salty animal quality that is not for the faint of heart.  Coupled with the indolic floral notes is an intoxicating and layered smokiness.  As the veil of smoke lifts you notice a sensuous bouquet of roses with a serious edge - no coy looks or twee manner from these flowers.  The progression of Warda Al Oud bears a layer of vanilla and amber that begin to sing on the skin, enveloping the entire composition in a seductive and mysterious embrace."," Bergamot, Jasmine, Bulgaria, Damascus Rose, Osmanthus, Vanilla, Amber, Musk, Cambodian Oud",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/63402.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Jeke Parfum Extrait,Slumberhouse," Jeke is a tobacco based fragrance with ornaments of spice, smoke and sweetness. Its heart is a rich accord of tobacco absolutes (Bulgarian, French and Spanish) paired with bourbon vanilla absolute and honey to create a sweet, milky tobacco base. The smoke and spice are constructed in a way to evoke the feeling of desolate autumn nights - the sting of smoke and the spice of burning leaves drifting through the cold black air."," Tobacco, vanilla, smoke, labdanum, patchouli, honey, clove",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/63100.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, tobacco
Almost Transparent Blue Eau de Toilette,A Lab on Fire," Almost Transparent Blue takes the classic elements of cologne and tweaks them to create a futuristic urban citrus, with hints of pavement and ink. The yuzu and lime in the opening are beautifully crystalline and sharply realistic, and the citrus stays crisp and sparkling as the scent evolves.  A brisk, hyper-real soap note emerges, with subtle hints of something industrial underneath. This has the stark feel of an abandoned city  a landscape carved in glass and steel, spare and stripped clean and angular, with empty monorail tracks slicing through the sky.  The chilly aldehydes are countered by warm cedar and the dry and clarifying scent of hinoki, the prized cypress that grows only in Japan. Hinoki wood is used to make the finest soaking baths and it has a distinctive, incense-like scent  airy, but haunting. Our first impression of this was cool, clean and simple, but as we spend more time with it, we would strike the word simple. This ultramodern blend of citrus and wood has just enough strangeness to make it utterly compelling."," Lime, yuzu, thyme flower, aldehyde, hinoki, cedar wood, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/56708.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, lime
Rouge Assassin,Jovoy Paris," Two types of women from the Twenties mingle in the same space without ever really meeting: One isla maitresse de ces messieurs, a mistress in the tradition of the Second Empire and thegarÃ§onne, a term for the emancipated woman, whose look may have been androgynous at times, but who Rouge Assassin pays tribute to those fearless, unstoppable women who upended the established order and broke all the rules. While the garÃ§onne look is sometimes considered masculine, femininity is what came through in the way women wore their hair and makeup, in their attitudes, their hunger for freedom and the insatiable desire to love without regard for social codes and conventions. She was the first in the history of women's fashion to reveal her legs. Soon, brassieres would replace corsets. Thick stockings vanished in favor of silk ones worn rolled over a garter above the knee. It was at this time that the first lipsticks appeared.The scent opens with the mysterious quality of both women's scents intermingling - sweet cigar smoke swirls and twirls in the dim light until it collides with a seductive cloud of powder.  Everything is in silhouette as the scent draws you in to explore its development -  the lipstick iris and saturated rose notes give way to a plush cushion of ambrette, vanilla, and benzoin.  The cedar note lends a kick of smoke that evokes a bewitching image - a pair of glossy red lips smoking a clove cigarette.Thanks to the collaboration of perfumer AmÃ©lie Bourgeois, Rouge Assassin is an homage to femininity that blends lipstick notes (iris butter), with the scent of skin (rice bran, musk, powdery floral accords) and echoes of Parisian cabarets. Men who wear it are either incurable risk-takers or they are Machiavellian schemers."," Bergamot, Fresh rose, elemi, solar accord, Iris, rice bran, ambrette seed, Virginia cedar, white musk, sandalwood, vanilla, Tonka bean, benzoin",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/61608.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Knize Forest Eau de Toilette,Knize," Knize Forest is green and at the same time soft and balmy. It has a contingent of bergamot. The heart is aromatic, spicy and a little woody on a base of ambergris and musk. Memories of the wide, green grassland of Ireland awaken in us.Knize was founded in Vienna in 1858. After the death of founder Joseph KniÅ¾e in 1880, his son Joseph Knize Jun took over the business. In 1888 KniÅ¾e received the coveted title of royal tailor to the Austro-Hungarian Court. By the turn of the century many personalities, heads of state, artists and industrialists belonged to the select group of Knize's customers."," Orange, Lemon, Petitgrain, Bergamot, Lavender, Rosemary, Sage, Oregano, Basil, Geranium, Rosewood, Carnation, Vetiver, Patchouly, Sandalwood, Ambergris, Labdanum (Rockrose), Oakmoss, Musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/52704.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, orange
Acqua Decima Eau de Toilette,Eau d'Italie," Acqua Decima, as its name indicates in Italian, is the tenth fragrance in the Eau d'Italie collection. Born nearly ten years ago as a celebration of Hotel Le Sirenuse's 50th anniversary, Eau d'Italie has become a collection of fragrances that evokes Italy's many seductive faces: not only summer in Positano, but also the roses of Paestum, winter in Tuscany and Umbria, the spirit of Venice, magnolias in Rome, a garden in Sicily, Capri and la dolce vita on the Amalfi coast.Now Acqua Decima celebrates the spirit of Italy itself, with quintessentially Mediterranean sensations like the scented notes that greet us along The Path of the Gods, the spectacular mountain walk that links the Amalfi coast with the Bay of Sorrento, through cliffs in the wilderness over a glimmering blue sea. The gold of lemons and mandarins, the warmth of Neroli, the fresh coolness of petitgrain, enlivened by zesty notes of mint leaves. The result is a fragrance which from the very first notes inevitably brings a smile to one's face and the immediate good mood we feel when we recognize classic notes we love. Acqua Decima is the fragrance that reflects the sunniest feelings we have inside. Say hello to your perfect summer scent!"," Lemon, mandarine, mint leaves, neroli, petitgrain, hedione, white wood, vetiver.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/43226.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, lemon
Lys 41 Eau de Parfum,Le Labo," A lavish, breathtaking, no-holds-barred big white floral that is drop-dead gorgeous.  While the lily gets top billing, two other divas also share the center stage  jasmine and tuberose absolute.  They make a grand entrance together, turning all the heads in the room  creamy tuberose, flirty jasmine and ravishing lily. We get the elegant and slightly spicy lily in the forefront, with her dazzling sisters close behind. But we should also note that on a blotter, it appears that the high pitched jasmine takes the lead and we have a friend who swears that, on her, the sweetness of the tuberose is more dominant; so the way this chord plays on your skin may vary somewhat. In any configuration, you get a profusion of glowing white petals -- a soaring mix of the heady qualities of all three blooms -- warmed with gentle woods and a dreamy, cozy vanilla. While this is definitely not light in the sense of being understated, it is light in the sense of being airy and buoyant. It is an expansive airiness - a large billowy cloud of something weightless: rows and rows of ballerinas spinning in tutus, hundreds of white butterflies being released into the air, an impossibly long chiffon veil floating in the wind. Lys 41 is also filled with light  the bright white flowers have a brilliant luminosity which is burnished to a soft pearlescent sheen by the musk and vanilla.   The expectations are always high with Le Labo, and Lys 41, created in collaboration with one of Le Labo's iconic noses, DaphnÃ© Bugey, does not disappoint.  They have created the white floral that we wear in our dreams.Personalize your fragrance:  Enter your custom message or name at checkout and we'll have Le Labo print it on your label.Please note: Complimentary samples available with any product purchase.

Gold Rose Oudh Extrait de Parfum,Tiziana Terenzi," Barefoot amidst the charm and mystery of fire in a desert camp.  The warm, sensual notes of a strange night in the wilderness; the soothing spicy fragrance; the evocative power of roses; and the ancestral and reassuring perfume of honey; all of them are celebrated in the power of the flame.Tiziana Terenzi makes her debut with four Extrait de Parfum dedicated to the remembrance of fire.  Precious and refined extracts of an endless journey."," Bergamot, Fir, Ember, Sand accord, Rose, Patchouli, Black Pepper, Oudh, Amber, Sandalwood, Musk, Honey",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/62003.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Les Jeux Sont Faits Eau de Parfum,Jovoy Paris," In the 1960s,  a particular kind of rogue flourished in French cinema, exemplified by actors Jean Gabin and Lino Ventura. Their natural habitat was the smoky gambling den, the atmosphere thick with vice and retro masculinity. With Jovoy's woody aromatic perfume Les Jeux Sont Faits (The Bets Have Been Placed), FranÃ§ois HÃ©nin wanted to pay homage to those louche and romantic icons that marked an era. English gin clinking in a tumbler with ice  aromatic, fresh, and cold  is evoked by the astringent herb angelica as Les Jeux Sont Faits sounds its first notes. Its juniper-like sharpness gives way to accords that recall the woodwork, leather chairs, and gaming men in clandestine gambling clubs: tobacco leaves, cumin, sandalwood, patchouli and leather. To offset these olfactory signifiers of masculinity is a warm and fruity accord rounded off by vanilla and labdanum, which also recalls Old Cuban rums.As it dries down, Les Jeux Sont Faits' balance of herby petitgrain, boozy accords, woods and spice warmed with vanillic notes makes for one sexy scent you can bet on: this one's a winner."," Petitgrain, angelica, dried fruits, rum, gin, tobacco leaf, cumin, sandalwood, patchouli, vanilla, labdanum.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/61606.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, petitgrain
Psychedelique Eau de Parfum,Jovoy Paris," PsychÃ©dÃ©lique,  Jovoy's magnificent ambered patchouli,  largely stays in the shadows,  meditating on the synergies between a cocoa-like amber and an inky-dark patchouli,  although rose and geranium offer a touch of freshness to its earthy sexiness.The synaesthete might say that on the olfactory color wheel,  patchouli resides somewhere between black and chocolate brown,  with a bit of iridescent chartreuse green shimmering in between. Camphory,  inky,  aromatic,  and even darkly refreshing,  the elegant patchouli in PsychÃ©dÃ©lique isdark,  smoky,  ambered,  generous and opulent,  says FranÃ§ois HÃ©nin,  and in spite of its unfortunate branding given by unwashed hippies 1960s,  he says of this perfume thatEven the mud of Woodstock won't wash it away.PsychÃ©dÃ©lique is like an olfactory Mark Rothko painting that explores the gradations between dark colors  in this case,  patchouli,  amber,  and musk. Darkly seductive and even comforting,  you might even call it 50 Shades of Black."," Citrus, rose, geranium, amber, patchouli, cistus labdanum, vanilla, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/61605.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, citrus
Lumiere Blanche Eau de Parfum,Olfactive Studio," Picture a chalk cliff looming over a sea as still and metallic as mercury under a blazing sun... This is the picture selected by the renowned Italian photographer Massimo Vitali  whose work has been exhibited in major museums like the Guggenheim  as a brief for LumiÃ¨re Blanche (i.e.white light).To translate this concept of whiteness, but also the heat of the sun and the coolness of the sea, Sidonie Lancesseur has similarly played on olfactory contrasts. Coolness? A brace of cold spices like cardamom and star anise. Heat? The burn of cinnamon.  This spicy cocktail livens up a soothing, creamy blend of almond milk, sandalwood and tonka bean: the almond and sandalwood produce skin-loving milky effects, while the almond and tonka bean pick up on the licorice-y facets of the star anise. Powdery iris and musks add another, different layer of whiteness to a fragrance which, unusually, has a slightly milky aspect. A beautiful, sensuous yet candid fragrance that might just turn into your go-to bottle."," Cardamom, star anise, cinnamon, iris, almond milk, Cashmere wood, cedar, sandalwood, tonka bean, white musks",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/61501.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, cardamom
Autoportrait Eau de Parfum,Olfactive Studio," You'd think a photographer asked for a self-portrait would supply his likeness. Yet when CÃ©line Verleure, the owner of Olfactive Studio, reached out to Luc LapÃ´tre for a photographic fragrance brief, he offered a dream-like skyscape where a tiny, solitary figure walks under what looks like the sky reflected in a pool of water.To translate this meditative image into scent, the great Nathalie Lorson based her composition on age-old sacred resins: benzoin and incense. Autoportrait is a quiet, serene blend with a perfect balance of dry woodiness and soothing cuddliness (supplied by the milky vanilla facets of benzoin). Amazingly addictive yet deeply soulful, this seemingly simple scent keeps unfurling subtle facets, like ripples expanding on the surface of a lake."," Bergamot, elemi, Siam benzoin, incense, musks, oak moss, cedar, vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/61502.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Chambre Noire Eau de Parfum,Olfactive Studio," The dark room envisioned by ClÃ©mence RenÃ©-Bazin, an alumnus of the fabled Magnum agency, is in a hotel in Cairo with a view of the Nile, the modern city on the opposite bank rising in stark contrast with the antiquity of the legendary river...DorothÃ©e Piot's olfactive rendition of this image also draws on a contemporary vibe to express age-old ingredients. In fact, vintage fragrance lovers might well be delighted with this full-bodied blend: with its boozy, plummy notes, violet, patchouli and leather, Chambre Noire drops more than a hint of an old-school chypre. As though you'd smelled the sillage of Femme in a temple where incense had been burning.  After all, ancient Egyptians did consider that perfume was the sweat of the gods. All the more reason to treat yourself to this divine fragrance, as sensuous and mysterious as a hotel room in an exotic city  or as the innermost chamber of a temple dedicated to beauty."," Pink pepper, jasmine, papyrus (cypriol), violet, incense, prune, sandalwood, patchouli, musk, vanilla, leather",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/61503.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, pink pepper
Still Life Eau de Parfum,Olfactive Studio," Despite its name, drawn like all the Olfactive Studio fragrances from the vocabulary of photography, this life is anything but still. It's more like the life of the party! Inspired by FrÃ©dÃ©ric Lebain's playful picture of mirror balls, party streamers and confetti (a print is included in the box), the young, up-and-coming perfumer Dora Arnaud has concocted a sparkling cocktail. Playing on the natural affinities of citrus and pepper  they share lemon-y facets --, she livens up the flavorful Japanese yuzu fruit with a blend of three peppers including the rare and precious Sichuan pepper, for a stunningly original cool-hot contrast. Dark rum turns up the heat in the base notes, anchored with dry, woody facets.This fiery, fizzy cocktail is just begging to be translated into a drink, but as a stunningly original new take on citrus, it's also a fabulousenergy drink for your nose! Spritz on and dance the night away."," Yuzu, elemi, pink pepper, black pepper, Sichuan pepper, star anise, galbanum, dark rum, cedar, Ambrox",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/61504.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, yuzu
Fleur D'Oranger 27 Eau de Parfum,Le Labo," Three years in production, Le Labo's ode to orange blossom might be the most sublimely unisex rendition that we know. Simultaneously true-to-life and elegantly stylized, Fleur d'Oranger 27, showcases its star note by enhancing both its citrusy and green side. The zesty aspect of orange blossom is underscored by the sunny, sparkly bergamot, petitgrain and grapefruit. The fragile beauty of snow-white blossoms is made even more dazzling when contrasted with the verdancy of vetiver and the dark richness of amber and musk. Breezy, intense and delightfully ambiguous, this is an orange blossom to be enjoyed by men and women alike.Personalize your fragrance:  Enter your custom message or name at checkout and we'll have Le Labo print it on your label.Please note: Complimentary samples available with any product purchase.

Neroli 36 Eau de Parfum,Le Labo," Gracefully poised between a floral and a cologne, Le Labo's sunny creation is evocative of a morning walk on French Riviera...the blossoming trees, the sea breeze, the feeling of absolute well-being and contentment-- we don't know of a happier fragrance! After a fresh start, where neroli and mandarin orange sparkle with a slight hint of aldehydes and refresh us with a slight marine touch, jasmine starts to blossom, sweetened delicately by rose and vanilla.

Jasmin 17 Eau de Parfum,Le Labo," Jasmin 17, Maurice Roucel's unashamedly feminine creation for Le Labo, is guaranteed to make you feel pretty, oh so pretty! We know that the number in the title refers to the number of ingredients in the formula, but we suspect that it also has something to do with the fact this rendition of jasmine makes us feel like we are 17 again... no, it does not smelltoo young, it smells beautifully youthful! The radiant simplicity of the blend is what attracts us to Jasmin 17 the most. The pairing of vanilla and the airy jasmine, with its naturally honeyed undertone, is the proof that the most genius ideas are so very simple. The playful sensuality of the blend is enhanced by sandalwood and musk... and by Roucel's magical touch.

Vetiver 46 Eau de Parfum,Le Labo," One whiff of the powerful masculinity of Vetiver 46, and all we can say is, hello Clark Gable. Who better to personify the old world elegance, strength, and sheer charisma of this fragrance? Celebrated nose Mark Buxton weaves top grade Haitian vetiver with pepper and cedar to give Vetiver 46 a dark, steely backbone, and then warms its edges with clove and gaiac wood. A hint of incense adds grace. Over the hours, the radiance of amber and vanilla shows Vetiver 46's more sensitive side.

Bergamote 22 Eau de Parfum,Le Labo," Bergamote 22 started its life under the code nameFire Cologne, and as soon as we smelled the unexpected effervescent spiciness of its top notes, we knew why. Subtle but noticeable, the piquancy of nutmeg puts a twist on the classic citrus scent genre. The tingling spice compliments beautifully the fizzy notes of grapefruit and bergamot. The translucent green aspect brought on by petit grain is yet another layer that unfolds on the skin revealing the complex nature of this seemingly simple composition. The gauzy citrus notes are grounded by amber, musk and vetiver. The substantionality of the base notes gives Bergamote 22 weight and rich texture seldom found in citrus blends. A unisex fragrance with an unforgettable personality.Personalize your fragrance:  Enter your custom message or name at checkout and we'll have Le Labo print it on your label.Please note: Complimentary samples available with any product purchase.

Patchouli 24 Eau de Parfum,Le Labo," Le Labo is known for playing with our ideas of what a fragrance should be, and Patchouli 24 is no exception. With Patchouli 24, talented perfumer Annick Menardo takes the idea of patchouli-- a rebellious adventurer with a creative streak-- and spins it into a scent that upsets all expectations. Instead of smelling like the patchouli we know, Patchouli 24 is intensely leathery and smoky, like a worn leather jacket laid over a hot motorcycle engine. Counterbalanced against these notes is a creamy, custard-like vanilla. Patchouli 24's contradictions draw us back to our wrists to smell it again and again. If you want straight patchouli, look elsewhere. If you are open to a fragrance that embraces the idea of patchouli, and yet is like nothing you've smelled before, welcome to Patchouli 24.Personalize your fragrance:  Enter your custom message or name at checkout and we'll have Le Labo print it on your label.Please note: Complimentary samples available with any product purchase.

La Fille de Berlin Eau de Parfum,Serge Lutens,"The Girl from Berlin is Serge Lutens's third tribute to the rose, and his second to the divas of yesteryear after the Palais Royal exclusive Une Voix Noire, inspired by Billie Holliday... This time, the model remains unnamed, but she is obviously a creature of the decadent 1920s in Berlin: a sleek-legged, smoky-eyed femme fatale. Louise Brooks as the amoral Lulu in Pandora's Box,  a pre-Hollywood Marlene Dietrich crooningMen cluster to me like moths around a flame in The Blue Angel...  And how couldn't they? This angel is not blue, but as red as the petals of a blood-gorged rose. Here, the flower is expressed at its richest: you can almost taste its jamminess, lifted with metallic hints of pink and black pepper. But its velvety flesh is also a woman's, musky, honeyed and dark.A riveting, take-no-prisoners sillage monster, La Fille de Berlin is Lutens at the top of his flamboyant form. So femme a man could rock it. So true to the flower no rose lover should be without it.  So good it could even convert the rose-averse. Falling in love again, never wanted to... What I am to do? I can't help it."," Rose, violet, pink and black pepper, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36142.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, rose
La Route d'Emeraude Eau de Parfum,Isabey," ""La Route d'Emeraude"" is inspired, with a touch of nostalgia, by the journey leading to the Emerald Triangle (Thailand, Laos and Cambodia), filled with the scents of Jasmine Sambac and blooming flowers. Many Orient lovers took the path to these faraway lands and experimented sensations that are recaptured in this edition of the mythical perfume. Created in 1924, La Route d'Emeraude was designed by Julien Viard, in a faceted bottle and a jewel-like case, reminiscent of the splendor of the Far East.La Route d'Emeraude, is a sensational olfactive experience which holds a bewitching and opulent gem: Sambac Jasmine.Begin this experience and feel the sparkling freshness of bergamot spiced by cinnamon and softened by rose essence, unveiling a flamboyant floral bouquet. All the sensuality of Sambac jasmine intermingles with voluptuous Morocco jasmine absolute, orange flower and the richness of tuberose.

Enchanted Forest Eau de Parfum,The Vagabond Prince," Enchanted Forest is inspired by the endless sea of Russian forests and fairytales, as well as the most sensual ancient Slavic celebration named Kupala, rooted in the times of darkness, when all on the Earth knew its soul and its name (often too powerful to be uttered in vain or at all). French perfumer Bertrand Duchaufour, the famous creator of fragrances for L'Artisan Parfumeur, Comme des GarÃ§ons and Penhaligon's, built Enchanted Forest around black currant, the smell and taste of which are so beloved in Russia and many other countries where it grows.The challenge was great: I had to magnify the raw material (blackcurrant), a material used very often in perfumery and sometimes overused inelegantly through notes of red fruits, and in this regard I made a sort of soliflore. Soliflores are generally constructed on floral bases such as jasmine, rose, tuberose, but for Enchanted Forest the intention was quite different... and I had the idea of working the blackcurrant throughout the structure (head, heart, bottom) of the perfume. To do this, I used no less than a blackcurrant CO2 (an extract obtained directly from the blackcurrant buds, which is free of solvent residues), an absolute of blackcurrant and two different blackcurrant bases, including one of my own creation, to build a sort of skeleton, a vertical structure on which the entire perfume would be built.  Bertrand Duchaufour"," pink pepper, aldehydes, sweet orange, flower cassis, blackcurrant leaf, hawthorn, effects of rum and wine, rosemary, davana, blackcurrant buds absolute, CO2 blackcurrant, Russian coriander seed, honeysuckle, rose, carnation, vetiverm, opoponax, Siam benzoin, amber, oakmoss, fir balsam absolute, patchouli, castoreum, cedar notes, vanilla, musk.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/60000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, pink pepper
Nero Perfume Oil,Bruno Acampora," Intense and provocative. Nero is a take-no-prisoners woody oriental that mesmerizes and fascinates. It opens with citrus, but the moment of sunshine is fleeting as we enter a dark labyrinth of bittersweet saffron, bold cedar and hypnotic patchouli. The combination is dizzying  almost narcotic in nature  and we are led to an opulent lair filled with honeyed amber, burnished sandalwood and a deeply sensuous musk. Clearly, someone is up to no good. And if you are wearing this fragrance, it is probably you. As you would expect from Bruno Acampora, the musk note is incredible, and its warm, melting-into-the-skin quality keeps Nero smooth and balanced, and lets the darker elements frolic without running rampant over the entire composition. This means we can enjoy the risquÃ© decadence of cedar and saffron while still being perfectly welcome in polite society. In fact, we're fairly certain that if we were wearing this addictive blend, we would be welcome anywhere."," Citrus, saffron, cedar, patchouli, sandalwood, amber, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/37529.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, citrus
Musc - Eau de Parfum,Bruno Acampora," Every once in a while we encounter a fragrance that we instantly recognize as a forever-love and this is one of them. This is a truly superlative musk scent   deep, spicy and drop dead sexy. This isn't  soft, sheer, clean musk  this is dramatic, untamed, sensuous musk that will get you noticed when you walk into the room and make the object of your desire weak in the knees. If it isn't the best musk ever, it's certainly in the running for that title, and there isn't a one of us here at Luckyscent who didn't stockpile this little number immediately.  An astonishing unisex scent which accomplishes that rare feat of being equally alluring on a man or a woman. Absolutely stunning."," Musk, Rose, Violet, Vanilla, Cloves, Amber, Sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/37520.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, musk
Rosae Mundi Eau de Parfum,Profumum," Sometimes a rose fragrance can take a quiet and docile path, blushing and giggling with an innocent and soapy freshness. Classic and traditional - she's a safe bet and a loyal friend. Rosae Mundi is not that rose fragrance, and prefers not to show up to her boring parties. If she did decide to show, she'd kick down the door in a low cut dress and demand a man and a martini.Beginning with a tinge of berry sweetness that draws you in before it's too late, Rosae Mundi is a luscious and uncompromising beauty. She brings to the imagination a spontaneous trip to Venice and a night sloshed with wine and wilting roses. Rosae Mundi, or Rose of the World,  is a compilation of rose and earth - vetiver, patchouli, and cedar lend the rich and downy chaise upon which the divine rose curls. As the scent develops, these earthly pleasures divulge their secrets on the skin - complimenting one another beautifully. It seems as though this rose has been everywhere and seen everything, and yet still rises (though not too early, let's not push it) with a curiosity and eagerness to see what the new day holds."," Rose, patchouli, vetiver, cedar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/33936.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, rose

Small and convenient for traveling or purse. Use it on your pulse points, on your hair, your beard. The oil scent keeps close to the skin for a long lasting effect. Gracefully poised between a floral and a cologne, Le Labo's sunny creation is evocative of a morning walk on French Riviera...the blossoming trees, the sea breeze, the feeling of absolute well-being and contentment-- we don't know of a happier fragrance! After a fresh start, where neroli and mandarin orange sparkle with a slight hint of aldehydes and refresh us with a slight marine touch, jasmine starts to blossom, sweetened delicately by rose and vanilla. The base of musk and tonka bean lends the airy perfume warmth and sensuality.

Small and convenient for traveling or purse. Use it on your pulse points, on your hair, your beard. The oil scent keeps close to the skin for a long lasting effect. Bergamote 22 started its life under the code nameFire Cologne, and as soon as we smelled the unexpected effervescent spiciness of its top notes, we knew why. Subtle but noticeable, the piquancy of nutmeg puts a twist on the classic citrus scent genre. The tingling spice compliments beautifully the fizzy notes of grapefruit and bergamot. The translucent green aspect brought on by petit grain is yet another layer that unfolds on the skin revealing the complex nature of this seemingly simple composition. The gauzy citrus notes are grounded by amber, musk and vetiver. The substantionality of the base notes gives Bergamote 22 weight and rich texture seldom found in citrus blends. A unisex fragrance with an unforgettable personality.Personalize your fragrance:  Enter your custom message or name at checkout and we'll have Le Labo print it on your label."," bergamot, petitgrain, grapefruit, nutmeg, orange blossom, aspic, cedar, amber, musk and vetiver.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/46831.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot

The oil scent keeps close to the skin for a long lasting effect. Le Labo is known for playing with our ideas of what a fragrance should be, and Patchouli 24 is no exception. With Patchouli 24, talented perfumer Annick Menardo takes the idea of patchouli-- a rebellious adventurer with a creative streak-- and spins it into a scent that upsets all expectations. Instead of smelling like the patchouli we know, Patchouli 24 is intensely leathery and smoky, like a worn leather jacket laid over a hot motorcycle engine. Counterbalanced against these notes is a creamy, custard-like vanilla. Patchouli 24's contradictions draw us back to our wrists to smell it again and again. If you want straight patchouli, look elsewhere. If you are open to a fragrance that embraces the idea of patchouli, and yet is like nothing you've smelled before, welcome to Patchouli 24.Personalize your fragrance:  Enter your custom message or name at checkout and we'll have Le Labo print it on your label."," Patchouli, birch tar, styrax, and vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/46832.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, patchouli

Small and convenient for traveling or purse. Use it on your pulse points, on your hair, your beard. The oil scent keeps close to the skin for a long lasting effect. Jasmin 17, Maurice Roucel's unashamedly feminine creation for Le Labo, is guaranteed to make you feel pretty, oh so pretty! We know that the number in the title refers to the number of ingredients in the formula, but we suspect that it also has something to do with the fact this rendition of jasmine makes us feel like we are 17 again... no, it does not smelltoo young, it smells beautifully youthful! The radiant simplicity of the blend is what attracts us to Jasmin 17 the most. The pairing of vanilla and the airy jasmine, with its naturally honeyed undertone, is the proof that the most genius ideas are so very simple. The playful sensuality of the blend is enhanced by sandalwood and musk... and by Roucel's magical touch.

Small and convenient for traveling or purse. Use it on your pulse points, on your hair, your beard. The oil scent keeps close to the skin for a long lasting effect. Three years in production, Le Labo's ode to orange blossom might be the most sublimely unisex rendition that we know. Simultaneously true-to-life and elegantly stylized, Fleur d'Oranger 27, showcases its star note by enhancing both its citrusy and green side. The zesty aspect of orange blossom is underscored by the sunny, sparkly bergamot, petitgrain and grapefruit. The fragile beauty of snow-white blossoms is made even more dazzling when contrasted with the verdancy of vetiver and the dark richness of amber and musk. Breezy, intense and delightfully ambiguous, this is an orange blossom to be enjoyed by men and women alike.Personalize your fragrance:  Enter your custom message or name at checkout and we'll have Le Labo print it on your label."," bergamot, petitgrain, grapefruit, amber, musk and vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/46838.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot

Who better to personify the old world elegance, strength, and sheer charisma of this fragrance? Celebrated nose Mark Buxton weaves top grade Haitian vetiver with pepper and cedar to give Vetiver 46 a dark, steely backbone, and then warms its edges with clove and gaiac wood. A hint of incense adds grace. Over the hours, the radiance of amber and vanilla shows Vetiver 46's more sensitive side.

Lys 41 Perfume Oil,Le Labo," A lavish, breathtaking, no-holds-barred big white floral that is drop-dead gorgeous. While the lily gets top billing, two other divas also share the center stage  jasmine and tuberose absolute. They make a grand entrance together, turning all the heads in the room  creamy tuberose, flirty jasmine and ravishing lily. We get the elegant and slightly spicy lily in the forefront, with her dazzling sisters close behind. But we should also note that on a blotter, it appears that the high pitched jasmine takes the lead and we have a friend who swears that, on her, the sweetness of the tuberose is more dominant; so the way this chord plays on your skin may vary somewhat. In any configuration, you get a profusion of glowing white petals -- a soaring mix of the heady qualities of all three blooms -- warmed with gentle woods and a dreamy, cozy vanilla."," Jasmine, tuberose absolute, lily, warm woody notes, vanilla madagascar and musks",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/46869.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, jasmine

Akkad Eau de Parfum,Lubin," Akkad is a luminous amber perfume, mystical but also sensual, a descent into the profane pleasures of ancient tyrants, an exhalation of sacred oils and precious spices.Delphine Thierry, who composed this creation, imagined an amber note that is both spicy and luminous. The opposite therefore of the dark, mystical ambers that bring to mind the smoke of frankincense in ancient temples. Akkad amber opens with an aromatic citrus head note of mandarin and bergamot, enhanced by Clary sage. Clary sage, also known asthe sacred herb, is renowned for its euphoric, harmonising properties. The heart unfolds in the rich, balmy, spicy notes of frankincense and styrax, evocative of the ancient east, cooled by elemi, a fresh, soothing herb, and intensified by cardamom. The base with its two ambers of plant and animal origin centres on the woody richness of patchouli, sweetened with a sensual vanilla."," Mandarin, bergamot, clary Sage, cardamom, elemi, frankincense, styrax, amber and cistus labdanum, vanilla and patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/31218.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, mandarin
Galaad Eau de Parfum,Lubin," Galaad is a exotic leather fragrance, an invitation on a journey, the scent of an elegant rider who travels the world, a cosmopolitan spirit who loves the shade of tall trees and the freshness of mountain streams. A fragrance that is protective and assertive, yet utterly refined, emanating a peaceful self-assurance.A heart of myrrh is topped with spices that bring out refreshing head notes (cardamom), and sustained by aromatic base notes (rosemary, cypress). The base is cool leather with wood and tobacco (blond tobacco, Atlas cedar, agar oud). Delphine Thierry, who created Galaad, invites us to a tranquil morning ride in the mountains of the Middle East, when the scents of myrrh bushes blend with cypress resins and the woody fragrance of cedars. The leather of saddle and gloves gently warm up in the first rays of sun, while the little Arab horse snorts amidst the morning dew that has settled on Judean balsam trees and on the vines climbing along the mountain slopes of Galaad."," Cardamom, cypress, rosemary, myrrh, honey, copahu balm, Agar oud, Atlas cedar, cipriol, blond Burley tobacco",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/31219.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, cardamom
Cuir Velours Eau de Parfum,Naomi Goodsir," An opulent and boozy leather scent that is as velvety and luscious as a fresh peach. The leather note is smooth and supple, almost creamy, and is generously laced with rich tobacco, decadent rum and the dark, rough sweetness of the immortelle flower. At its best, as it is here, immortelle strikes us as the olfactory equivalent of a cat's purr  hints of ripe fruit and fresh hay wrapped in cozy, honeyed warmth. It winds itself around the leather and tobacco in the most delicious way. Incense and cistus labdanum add complexity, but with gentle brushstrokes. This is not a fragrance that startles and challenges  this is a fragrance that beckons, inviting you to take a long, luxurious stretch before settling into the couch. Rich and satisfying -- as comfortable to wear as your favorite worn-in leather jacket.All Naomi Goodsir Parfums include an atomizer spray."," Leather, tobacco, rum, cistus labdanum, incense, fleur d'immortelle",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/59300.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, leather
Interlude Man Eau de Parfum,Amouage," Interlude Man is a spicy  woody fragrance that opens with zesty bergamot, oregano and pimento berry oil, perpetuating intervals of conflict which are countered by aromatic notes of amber, frankincense, opoponax, cistus and myrrh. Eternal notes of leather, agarwood smoke, patchouli and sandalwood in the base add lasting layers of depth and texture. I interpret what I see and feel into scents. All the social and natural chaos and disorder surrounding us today can be translated to a much more intimate level.

LiquidNight Eau de Parfum,A Lab on Fire," The secrets of a New York City evening are masterfully explored in Liquid Night from A Lab On Fire. Smooth with a woody-sweet finish, this fragrance mines the hidden depths of the night, beginning with its full-of-anticipation, heading-out-on-the-town opening (represented by lively, joyful citruses like bergamot and lime). Its heart beats wildly with a melting pot of exotic (saffron) and familiar (sage and lavender), while at its base is midnight-- the true soul of the city, mystical (incense and Hinoki wood), sensual (musk) and addictive (vanilla)."," Bergamot, lime, saffron, sage, lavender, Hinoki wood, incense, vanilla, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/56703.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
08 - Seylon Eau de Parfum,Odin," Harvested from the wild landscapes of Sri Lanka comes a scent that truly represents an authentic interpretation of pure vetiver. Seylon opens with the watery crispness of fresh yuzu followed by the tartness of bitter orange and bergamot. Middle notes of spicy nutmeg, resinous elemi and wormwood merge together with a rich base of warm benzoin, damp oakmoss and the soft earthiness of calming vetiver.The creation of 08 Seylon communicates a new understanding of vetiver through a calming blend of rich, earthy aromas. During the initial stages of development it was essential that the fragrance represent actual vetiver, extracted from the root. With this in mind, not only is the finished concept  an authentic interpretation, it also reflects perfumer, Phillipe Romano's idea that imposing structures such as orientals, woods, spices with exotic shades should transport you far away."," Yuzu, Bitter Orange, Bergamot, Nutmeg, Resinous Elemi, Wormwood, Benzoin, Damp Oakmoss, Vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/50112.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, yuzu
Santal Majuscule Eau de Parfum,Serge Lutens," Now that Santal Blanc has been shifted to the exclusive Palais-Royal collection, Serge Lutens's export line was bereft of a scent showcasing one of the major materials of his oriental palette. Santal Majuscule, which meanssandalwood with a capital letter, plays on the secular harmony of this creamy, smoky, almost floral note with roses. The unexpected twist is the addition of cocoa  not the dry, powdery type matched with patchouli in Borneo 1834, but a smooth touch of chocolate that marries with the milkiness of sandalwood in a subtly gourmand accent. A tender, subtle rendition of the note: inmajuscule, you could readmagic  as in the magical world of a little black-eyed boy called Serge, who put capital letters to words likeGold,Fire andFlowers."," Sandalwood, rose, cocoa, tonka bean",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36141.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, sandalwood
Anbar,Comme des Garcons: Cologne," Anbar takes its name from the original Arabic name for amber.

X for Men Eau de Parfum,Clive Christian," Take the lushest jasmine and light it on fire with the warming spices of cinnamon, ginger and cardamom. Let it smolder on a bed of rich orris and vanilla as aromatic rays of cedarwood subtly radiate in the background, and you have Clive Christian's cuddly yet sexy X for Men.In Clive Christian's X Series, perfume's aphrodisiac qualities are brought to the fore. In X for Men, orris (from the Iris flower's buttery rich and powdery soft roots) and Karo Karundi (a white flower essence from the West African shrub whose scent is reminiscent of Acacia) both help to power X for Men's gentle eros. Although cedarwood, a conventionally masculine note, hums continuously throughout X for Men, the perfume leans closer as a unisex fragrance, and could equally be inhaled from a male or female lover's pulse points and neck.Complimentary samples available with any product purchase.

1872 for Women Eau de Parfum,Clive Christian," Inside its verdant bottle originally designed inthe  momentous year of its name,  1872 for Women houses an effervescent rose whose clean,  fresh and green notes burst forth as if from a popped champagne bottle. Interestingly,  for a perfume named after the past,  1872 for Women recalls nothing of rose's usual conservative and stodgy reputation. This is a young and fresh rose,  with top notes such as bergamot,  tangerine and lemon and a light chypre dry down of patchouli,  moss,  cedar,  sandalwood and musk.A sheer and fresh Rose de Mai  whose green facets are pushed to the fore by lily of the valley  glimmers at the heart of 1872 for Women. Also known as thepainter's rose,  this precious flower blooms only for three weeks in Grasse,  France,  and it takes 170 heads of Rose de Mai for just one drop of 1872 for Women. With intense projection and longevity,  1872 belies its central flower's poetically short life. Hesperidic,  clean and cheerful,  1872 is a jolt for the senses."," Bergamot, tangerine, lemon, pineapple, blueberry, rosemary, rose de Mai, lily of the valley, jasmine, purple violet, freesia, cedarwood, sandalwood, patchouli, erogen musk, and moss.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/58003.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
No. 1 for Men Eau de Parfum,Clive Christian," Wanting to push the parameters of what is acceptable, Clive Christian turned his creative design to having a fragrance for the night.

It is a perfume which stands out from the crowd; it is the fragrance of ultimate luxury. Starting with intensely green herbal notes of bergamot, lime and mandarin, No. 1 for men soon plunges into a carnal world of cardamom-spiced rich vanilla, amber and Mysore Indian sandalwood. Fresh yet rich, clean yet indolic, No. 1 for Men's mandarin-tinged florals Ã¯Â¿Â½ rose, jasmine, and ylang-ylang float atop a second layer of rich base notes like a perfume version of hydroponics. Although categorized as an Oriental Amber, there's no ignoring this perfume's aromatic freshness, aided by subtle grapefruit and artemesia and lasting into the dry down like a veil over its warmer base. Like most of Clive Christian's scents designated for men, this elixir is easily categorized as unisex."," Bergamot, lime, Sicilian mandarin, cardamom, nutmeg, thyme, lily of the valley, rose, jasmine, ylang ylang, heliotrope, cedarwood, sandalwood, vetiver, ambery woods, and vanilla.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/58001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
1872 for Men Eau de Parfum,Clive Christian," 1872 for Men is one of two perfumes Clive Christian named as tribute to the year Queen Victoria granted her crown to revered British perfume house Crown Perfumery, acquired by the English perfumer in 1999.This citrusy and spicy chypre starts off with lime and grapefruit, combining with an intensely heady aromatic mix of petit grain, lavender and clary sage, creating an invigorating and luxurious blend that lifts the mood and heightens the senses. A touch of woods and pepper provide some background drama and atmosphere to these bright notes.Emperor Nero considered Clary Sage to be a sacred herb, and it is said he dispensed it to his troops to get them to focus and rejuvenate before battle. Described as a mix of neroli, lavender, musk and ambergris, Clary Sage indeed invigorates and fortifies. If green and herbaceous is your thing, 1872 for Men will delight your senses no matter what your gender."," Grapefruit, lime, bergamot, petit grain, black pepper, nutmeg, cyclamen, sage, freesia, tagete oil, jasmine, cedarwood, patchouli, olibanum, amber, and musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/58002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, grapefruit

The close ocean took him far away, inspiring in him extraordinary novels of adventure. Inspired by the father of literary science fiction, this eau de parfum for modern globe-trotters breathes its aromatic Hesperides-like scents, just as a marine breeze over a wild heath. A freshness tinted with sophistication."," Grapefruit, Citrus, Tangerine, Eucalyptus, Nutmeg, Pepper, Cedar, Incense, Vetiver, Pinecone",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/57605.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, grapefruit
Bamboo Harmony Eau de Parfum,By Kilian," BAMBOO HARMONY pays homage to Bamboo, considered by theMen of Letters as the symbol of human perfection. It is also the main component of their brush, the central element of calligraphy which, in Chinese culture, is the representation of Art and Beauty.BAMBOO HARMONY is the olfactive impression of a subtle sip of white tea taken in the heart of a bamboo.BAMBOO HARMONY opens with luminous notes of Bergamot, Bigarade and Neroli. The perfume then evolves through a comforting heart combining white tea leaves - known for their sumptuous flavor and lustrous color - and Mimosa, highlighted with a touch of spices. The unique character of the trail is given by rare MatÃ© Essence, interlaced with sensual fig leaves and oak moss.BAMBOO HARMONY is a moment of spirituality."," Bergamot, bigarade, neroli, white tea, mimosa, spices, MatÃ© Essence, fig, oak moss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/42546.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
S-ex Eau de Parfum,S-Perfume," S-ex (pronouncedes-ex) isn't another avant-garde perfume that claims, in flowery prose, to be the perfume representation of sweaty sheets. S-ex is hardcore sultry and fresh at the same time-- a sheer and sensual daredevil of a scent that toys with opposites. It's a wet, sensual skin musk meets just washed, clean skin; all through it is a animalistic leather (with a metallic tinge) toying with fresh and crisp notes like bergamot. S-ex is a well balanced study of opposites attract; and we like that despite the name, it's not some one-trick-pony weighed down solely by heavy hitters. Instead, it arouses your senses with both depth and sheerness; it's steely and gentle, quiet and smoldering, and it does it all without falling in the women's-only or men's-only scent camp. If you love sensual, headboard-grabbing fragrances but have longed for a perfume that's wearable anywhere and any time of day, then a little S-ex is just what you need. In the V magazine, Author Chandler Burr once wrotea masterful, complex juxtaposition of elements that gives the scent of the genitalia of a freshly shampooed beast."," bergamot, nutmeg, pepper, leather, jasmine, sandalwood, patchouli, birchwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/57401.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Le Roi Empereur Eau de Parfum,Rance," With his coronation as King of Italy on May 26th, 1805 in Milan, thus taking on the dual title of EMPEROR and KING, NAPOLEON reached the peak of his glory. Only Charlemagne, one thousand years before him, had succeeded in bringing the whole of Europe under his rule.This was the highest consecration of military and political genius, which led to the fulfilment of the ideals of Liberty and Reform of the French Revolution. The whole of Europe acclaimed the HERO, and FranÃ§ois RancÃ©, his master perfumer and devoted admirer, created for him a fragrance which expressed his virile and fiery nature.The fresh scents of lavender and orange flower, together with the green, aromatic overtones of anise, blend with amber and Reunion cinnamon to create a symphony of intense accords. Leather exalts the masculine character, while cedar and musk give intensity and persistence to the fragrance."," Lavender, orange flower, anise, cardamom, violet, iris, amber, leather, cinnamon, cedar, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/57302.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, lavender
Fils de Dieu Eau de Parfum,Etat Libre d'Orange," The tagline for this Fils de Dieu, du Riz et des Agrumes (Son of God, rice and citrus isHe brings the sunshine). But despite these distinctly religious references, there is nary a tear of incense in Ralf Schwieger's dÃ©but scent for Ãtat Libre d'Orange. And despite a list of notes that almost reads like the recipe for a South-eastern Asian dish, Fils de Dieu never veers into the foody: rather, it shows how the aromas lacing one of the most refined cuisines in the world are also perfumes. The green, citrusy top notes add sparkle to the cardamom and ginger, churning up the milky, powdery accents of the rice and coconut notes. The latter is picked up by the lactonic facets in jasmine, while a rich May rose hints that the Queen of flowers and steamed rice may have secret affinities.Then as it moves into the drydown, Fils de Dieu reveals its animal nature by exhaling a soft, dark leather note, more suede than rawhide, infused with musk. And we sing Hallelujah."," Ginger, coriander leaves, lime, shiso, bergamot, Jungle Essence coconut, rice note, Jungle Essence cardamom, jasmine, cinnamon, French May rose, tonka bean, vetiver, musk, amber, leather, castoreum.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/47741.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, ginger
Bijou Romantique Eau de Parfum,Etat Libre d'Orange," The name comes from a line said by Hugo Pratt's cult graphic novel hero, the half-gypsy sailor Corto Maltese, in The Ballad of the Salt Sea:Adieu, bijou romantique (Farewell, romantic jewel). The tagline,Her price is far above rubies, is drawn from the Scriptures.As for the scent, it is by Mathilde Bijaoui, whose dark beauty would have surely inspired Hugo Pratt had he known her. It was Mathilde who signed the critically acclaimed Tilda Swinton Like This, and with Bijou Romantique she offers another delicately hued composition that hovers just on the edge of being the most ethereal gourmand, with the subtle chocolate facets of iris, vetiver blending into the creaminess of vanilla and benzoin. Laboratoire Mane's captive molecule EVEE bridges the gap between vanilla and spices, lightly brushing the blend with the burn of clove.Tender, complex and multi-facetted, Bijou Romantique lives up to its name. Who knew the bad boys at Ãtat Libre d'Orange had it in them to be so chivalrous?"," Bergamot, Italian lemon, pink pepper essence, ylang-ylang, clary sage, Tuscan iris, Jungle Essence coconut, Haitian vetiver, patchouli, benzoin, vanilla.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/47742.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Precious Oud Eau de Parfum,Van Cleef & Arpels," In 2009, Van Cleef & Arpels Haute Parfumerie stepped out with a range sublimating emblematic essences. That is how Collection Extraordinaire, a range of monofloral compositions and a cologne, came about. Today, a new chapter has been added to this wonderful story. Following on from the great classics, the timeless foundations of the collection, afree form piece glorifying Oud essence has been created.The new opus, Precious Oud, pays homage to a mythical essence. The aquilaria, an Asian or Indian tree, actually only reveals its powerful scent via the infection of the wood by a fungus. A magi-like essence alongside frankincense and myrrh, the fragrant Oud resin, woody and balsamic, adds earthy and leathery accents. The perfumer Amandine Marie has chosen to interpret Oud essence and associate it with flowers. The top note is bright and sparkling bergamot set off with pink peppercorn whilst already hinting at the tonality of the perfume with the scent of opulent incense. The heart note is a vibrant bouquet of the most beautiful flowers - sensual jasmine accompanied by tuberose. If not the queen of perfumery, then the tuberose could very well be the empress with its bewitching, divinely heady scent. There is a woody note of patchouli, and the base notes open up, opulent, rich and precious, surrounding the mythical Oud with the woody notes of sandalwood and vetiver and enveloping it in accents of amber.With its warm and sensual sillage, Precious Oud embodies the new opus of Collection Extraordinaire. A perfume with character, it has paved the way for new inspiration, totally free art where only the most noble, precious materials are given pride of place and the guiding principle is excellence."," bergamot, pink pepper, incense, jasmine, tuberose, patchouli, oud, sandalwood, vetiver and ambergris",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/50207.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
What We Do In Paris Is Secret Eau de Parfum,A Lab on Fire," You know how the notes in some perfumes read like something from your wildest, fragrant dreams but end up smelling like a Franken-fume, something you should love but don't, something that's less than the sum of its parts? What We Do In Paris Is Secret actually exceeds the gorgeous sounding symphony of its notes (and that's a hard thing to do!). It's impossible not to be lured in by the rich, sweet notes of vanilla, honey, tonka bean and tolu, the warm sensuality of sandalwood, musks, ambergris, and the playful Turkish rose, lychee and bergamot. Addictive doesn't quite explain it-- we couldn't keep this away from our skin when we first sampled (honestly) and oh, by the way? It makes heads turn. Not in thatYou're leaving a vapor trail! way, but in that,Please tell me what you're wearing now! way. Creamy, decadent, honeyed and sensual. If those are the kind of words that make your heart race when you think of a perfume, then look no further."," Bergamot, honey, lychee, Turkish rose essence, tonka bean, vanilla, heliotrope, tolu, sandalwood, ambergris, musks",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/56701.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Pluie de Soleil Eau de Toilette,Phaedon," Loosely translated, you could say Pluie de Soleil meansIt's raining sunshine. At any rate, that's what this exhilarating fragrance feels like, each drop carrying a succulent burst of summer. With its fresh fruity facets, freesia melds seamlessly with strawberry and pineapple, while adding a touch of frilly femininity. This is fruity floral done right, with just enough sandalwood to keep it from toppling into Tropicana. Fun, unpretentious, and as colorful as a summer market."," Bergamot, lemon, freesia, strawberry, pineapple, sandalwood, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/56605.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Eau Rose Eau de Toilette,Diptyque," Eau Rose, a fresh-floral perfume that pays tribute to the queen of flowers, the rose. Forever immortalized by Ronsard's famous poemMignonne, allons voir si la rose..., it was only a matter of time before diptyque decided to showcase the rose. To get off the beaten track and create something different, the Eau Rose has been conceived to stand out as a genuine infusion of roses. Its olfactory composition is designed to celebrate the multiple aromas of the flower in its natural state, as it blossoms over time. It's like taking an olfactory stroll, which you savor from morning to night, by wearing a rose that changes as the hours go by and melts into the scent of the person wearing it."," Bergamot, black currant, Centofilia and Damask rose, white musk, cedar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/48385.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Eccelso Eau de Parfum,Profumum," You don't always need to reinvent the wheel. Sometimes you just need to make an excellent wheel that gets you where you want to go in style. Eccelso is a divinely elegant scent for gentlemen, with a classic feel. Do not mistake classic for dull, however - the components are exquisite, the craftsmanship is impeccable and the result is not only magnificent, but incredibly appealing.  The vibrant opening of sparkling bergamot spiked with nutmeg perfectly paves the way for a creamy, lemon-tinged magnolia. A luxurious base of sensuous musk, Mysore sandalwood, patchouli and labdanum adds layers of warmth and depth. The result is complex and nuanced, with glimmers of smoke and spice playing off the citrus aspect that has been enriched and rounded by the magnolia. This is rich and reassuring, but it also has an easy charm that oozes confidence and a dash of mystery. This is the rakish younger son who surprises everyone when he is called upon to rule and rises to the occasion to become a beloved monarch. Truly exceptional."," Bergamot, nutmeg, magnolia, Mysore sandalwood, musk, patchouli, labdanum resin",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/33933.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
07 Tanoke Eau de Parfum,Odin," Developed by perfumer Corinne Cachen, 07 Tanoke conjures the natural aromas of Californian landscapes near seaside terrains, amounting to a pure and recognizably American scent. Archived in the roots of the soaring redwood, 07 Tanoke brings forth the balsamic resin of wet gaiacwood wrapped in smoky incense. Crisp black pepper, bitter orange and spicy ginger hover over the surface for an airy, brightness that defines the masculine and feminine dichotomy that characterizes Odin New York's growing palette of fragrances.Amid the wilderness of coastal hinterland comes a woody blend grounded in soaring redwoods and warm musk.  The core of Tanoke brings forth the balsamic resin of wet gaiacwood wrapped in smoky incense, crisp black pepper, spicy ginger and bitter orange hover the surface with invigorating freshness."," Ginger, Bitter Orange, Black Pepper, Gaiacwood, Smoky Incense, Nutmeg, Redwood, Patchouli, Black Musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/50107.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, ginger
Bluff,Lubin," At first a refreshing invigorating blend of citrus fruits, wood extracts and spices Bluff will then reveal itself as an extremely elegant yet sensual unisex eau de parfum. Inspired by the invigorating if not entirely effective remedies supplied to the pioneers in the Wild West during the 19th century gold rush. Once developed by emigrant physicians, these tonics were first considered medicine but they would soon become a part of American culture which would ultimately be further transformed into the soft drink culture at the turn of the 20th century.A distinguished fragrance with deceiving first impressions: crowned with lime, bergamot and an accord of nutmeg and cinnamon, Bluff opens fresh and spicy. It then reveals sensual, with mouthwatering heart notes of clary sage, iris and kola nut. This blend rests on an exquisite foundation of Vetiver cedar, patchouli and sandalwood vanilla."," Lime, bergamot, nutmeg, cinnamon, clary sage, iris, kola nut, vetiver cedar, patchouli, sandalwood, vanilla.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/31217.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, lime
Figaro Eau de Toilette,Lubin," The barber of Seville. Bold and seductive like the figaro from Beaumarchais' plays, Figaro in takes liberties with conventions much like the character who inspired it. An extremely original unisex fragrance, its construction is based on the daring opposition of vetiver and fig, which starts out green and ends up with gentle amber and woody base notes."," Grapefruit,  bergamot,  pink peppercorns,  marine pine, fig and apple,  damson,  coriander leaves,  clover,  essence of vetiver,  styrax,  sandalwood,  tonka bean.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/31215.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, grapefruit
Itasca Eau de Parfum,Lubin," The scent of North American forest. The Mississippi river finds its main source in the legendary Lake Itasca in the heart of Minnesota. Itasca is reminiscent of the forests covering the American landscape once inhabited by the Algonquin tribes and pioneers exploring the depths of the new continent.Core notes of Minnesotan red pine mingle with a base of amber, incense, vetiver Java and Texas cedar woods. After fresh top notes of juniper berries, a spicy harmony then unfolds where dominant woody notes are accented with clove and nutmeg.A spiced vetiver, Itasca opens with citrus fruits refreshed by juniper berries, followed by a harmonious combination of oriental woods, vetiver, and red Minnesotan pine. This scent evokes the forests that surround Lake Itasca, the source of the great Mississippi river, and a legendary place guarded by Algonquin Indians.UPDATE: We're thrilled to welcome back this long beloved spicy-fresh classic, now in a stronger Eau de Parfum concentration. While the subtle, airy woods and vetiver of the EDT are very much the same as they've always been, the new concentration means the freshness lingers for hours longer- albeit seductively close to the skin."," Neroli,   Marigold,   Mandarin,   Juniper Berry and Grapefruit,  Clove,   Tonka Bean,   Clary Sage,   Nutmeg,   Geranium Flower,  Itasca Red Pine (pinus resinosa),   Java Vetiver and Texan Cedar,   Partak Incense,   Ethiopian Myrrh,   Amber and Canadian Fir Balsam",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/31216.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, neroli
Azemour les Orangers Eau de Parfum,Parfum d'Empire," Parfum d'Empire fragrances are always highly concentrated both in rich natural essences and intense emotion. But even so, Azemour stands apart. Just as Eau de Gloire was a tribute to Corsica, the homeland of Marc-Antoine Corticchiato's family, Azemour is a loving reminiscence of Morocco where he was born and grew up. The name is taken from the ancient city of Azemmour on the Atlantic coast, near the orange groves his parents once owned. As for the scent, it is an olfactory landscape that captures the exhilarating fragrances of the orange tree, from the fruit and leaves to the flowers and bark, generously sprinkled with a blend of spices. A glorious quality of hay absolute, oak moss and henna absolute  a typically Moroccan scent reminiscent of Argentinean matÃ©  conjure the dry vegetation of the groves and dunes.  A tiny, briny accent (no, it isn't an aquatic note) adds a touch of sea spray. Wood notes trace the undulating silhouettes of cypresses in the Atlantic wind.And best of all, for those of us who love classic fragrance families, Azemour is a robust, vibrant, hesperidic chypre, so full-fleshed you'll feel you could bite it."," orange, clementine, tangerine, grapefruit, coriander, cumin, black pepper, pink pepper, blackcurrant, galbanum, neroli, geranium, orange blossom, rose, hay, moss, henna and cypres",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/35712.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, orange
Royal Oud,Creed," Wood, leather, marble, and gold. These luxurious elements of a Persian palace are the inspiration behind the architecture of Royal Oud. Precious, sweet oud is carefully extracted from agarwood trees, a carefully-guarded resource that grows only in certain parts of India. Oud's rarity lends to the expense of the fragrance's coveted raw materials, prized by both the men and women who wear it. A fashionable favorite amongst today's royals and heads of state, Royal Oud's universal blend bottles the splendor of palace life across continents."," Lemon, pinkberries, bergamot, cedar, galbanum, angelica roots, sandalwood, oud, Tonkin musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/49328.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, lemon
Pour un Homme Eau de Toilette,Caron," In the early 1930s, men's use of fragrance was not considered virile. However, one would occasionally dab on a touch of lavender water. Created in 1934, Pour Un Homme was the first Caron fragrance created exclusively for men. The lavender heart blended with vanilla, musk, and amber makes this fragrance truly unique. The yin and the yang of deep and refreshing scents highlight a mysterious duality and sophistication.  Pour Un Homme comes encased in a no-frills, masculine bottle."," Lavender, vanilla, musk, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/55313.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, lavender
Rhubarb Eau de Toilette,Comme des Garcons: Sherbet," Rhubarb is the tart one in the Sherbet series, perfectly capturing the sourness of a rhubarb stalk with a tiny dash of sweet. A beautifully fresh, green stem scent runs throughout the evolution, and it dries down to a creamier version--like an icy rhubarb sorbet mixed with a non-sweet (or overtly feminine) vanilla. We pick up a bit of wood (wenge) in there, too. Completely unique and unisex (go on, show us someone you know who wears a rhubarb scent), the tart green of Rhubarb is a study in converting taste into an exhilarating and crisp bottled scent. Extremely addictive, you just may drool a little when you smell this."," bergamot, rhubarb, litchee (aka lychee), orchid sap, cognassier flower, vanilla cream, wenge",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/22001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Honour Man Eau de Parfum,Amouage," Honour Man, the regal, dramatic masculine fragrance with a spicy, woody character, is heir to Amouage's ongoing (soap) operatic narrative that began with Jubilation, and continued on with Lyric, Epic, and Memoir.With an intensely peppery, dark opening, Honour Man creates olfactory storm clouds of disquiet, confusion, and drama befitting its back story, which was written by the perfume house's creative director Christopher Chong and inspired by Puccini's tragic opera Madame Butterfly.In Chong's melodramatic creative brief, Honour is the son of Madame Butterfly, Puccini's tragic heroine who commits suicide when the American soldier who abandoned her years before returns to take their son. Honour has come back, so the narrative goes, to confront his mother's tragedy and to come to terms with his identity.After the blast of pepper, Honour Man allows a fresh, rosy-floral note from geranium to peek through the dark clouds, followed by a succession of warm, woody, and spicy notes, including an intense patchouli that reminds us that Honour is still a fiery young man. Chong suggests that these comforting, beautifully blended base notes represent the reconciliation of our hero's troubled quest with hisfilial elegy to honour his mother. Its dry down does indeed feel like the denouement to a stormy, existential drama. Honour Man is housed in a white crystal bottle with a gold-plated cap affixed with a white opal Svarovski crystal."," Pink pepper, black pepper, geranium, elemi, nutmeg, patchouli, frankincense, cedarwood, vetiver, tonka bean, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/41824.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, pink pepper
Back to Black Eau de Parfum - ...,By Kilian," When you call your scentaphrodisiac, you'd better be fairly sure you're not overreaching yourself. This latest release from By Kilian, is the sixth composed for the house by Calice Becker, is as head-turning a love potion as you're ever likely to spritz on. That is, if you enjoy the velvet-smooth, burning liquid umber of a great cognac and the hay-like scent of tobacco steeped in fruit and honey, or sipping a fine amaretto on a bed of moss. Who doesn't?Back to Black is an olfactory trip to Arabia  or perhaps to the exotica-mad 1920s, when Caron gave Tabac Blond to sultry, cigarette-smoking garÃ§onnes. The tobacco accord is slyly evoked through the herbal, faintly animalic scent of chamomile laced with honey; the honey in its turn conjures faintly floral aromas. Throughout its development, Back to Black runs through a palette of subtly gourmand flavors, from ripe, almost fermented raspberry to the dry cocoa powder of patchouli, along with almond and vanilla, without ever veering into tooth-aching sweetness thanks to the bitter, cooling effect of cardamom, coriander, vetiver and moss.  It stretches out languorously on the skin for hours, displaying its dark facets, leaving you hungry for more Arabian nights in its amber glow."," Bergamot, raspberry, blue chamomile, cardamom, coriander, saffron, cedarwood, vanilla, almond, vetiver, cistus labdanum, patchouli, oakmoss.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/42522.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Aqua Universalis Forte Eau de Parfum,Maison Francis Kurkdjian," An aerial fragrance, at once light an powerful, like gold in the summer. With an exceptional concentration of 40%, it is on a par with a perfume extract.The olfactory composition has the same ""sunny"" emotions of the ""classical"" Aqua Universalis, but adds sparkle and intensity to its citrus charm. The nobility of its bouquet of white flowers is elevated by absolutes of rare Egyptian jasmin flower and Moroccan roses.The result is a fabulous, precious ""sillage"" or lingering trail left by this precious eau de parfum."," Bergamot, Sicilian citron, bouquet of white flowers, absolutes of Egyptian jasmin flowers and Moroccan roses, light woods.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/49824.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Tubereuse - Les Nombres d'Or Eau de Parfum,Mona di Orio," When we think of tuberose in perfume,  we often think of the version most perfumers like to emphasize: its nocturnal version,  when it exudes its most intense scent. More discreet and docile during the day,  the flower some callThe Queen of the Night emerges from its slumber when it's dark out to emit a deep and almost animalic aroma.In TubÃ©reuse,  Mona di Orio creates what she calls atwilight tuberose,  greener and fresher than its headier nocturnal incarnations but still intoxicating and rich. It opens with a beautiful and peppery burst of bergamot and green notes,  which almost gives tuberose the quality of having been tamed and made more transparent after a refreshing light rain.Soon,  the unmistakably narcotic tuberose slinks its way forward,  flanked by creamy notes from benzoin and amber matched with a milky nuttiness from heliotrope and coconut. Along with TubÃ©reuse's top notes,  the occasional sharp floral facet from heliotrope joins with tuberose's green facets,  balancing out its creamy and musky base notes.More approachable than its more femme fatale counterparts,  TubÃ©reuse nevertheless seduces. Perfect for tuberose fans that want a lighter,  friendlier,  more verdant interpretation of the flower."," Pink pepper, bergamot from Calabria, green leaves, Indian tuberose absolute, Siamese benzoin, heliotrope, Amber, coconut milk, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/51719.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, pink pepper
Hippie Rose Eau de Parfum,HEELEY," James Heeley's showroom in Paris is located in the Passage du DÃ©sir, and no address could be more suiting thanthe alley of Desire to the designer of such covetable fragrances. In Hippie Rose, the now-classic rose and patchouli accord is tinged with reminiscences of the journeys undertaken by the Flower Children and spiritual seekers of every decade: patchouli takes us to India, incense draw us into Himalayan temples, vetiver grounds us in the earth. It is from this earth that the carefree Hippie Rose rises, as soft and warm as the Californian desert wind in its silken amber and musk wrapping, but with a hint of toughness conjured by its woody-incense accord. Men and women both could take it on the road. Onward to the Summer of Love!"," Bergamot, green moss, Bulgarian rose, patchouli, incense, Haitian vetiver, amber, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/31518.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Gin Fizz Eau de Toilette,Lubin," In 1955, one movie star captivated the crowds. To the entire world she was the embodiment of American elegance and her mysterious charm even captured the heart of a Prince. To honor of her extraordinary beauty, Lubin created a perfume which marked the decade: An extremely chic fragrance, sparkling and fresh, evoking that year's most fashionable cocktail, Gin Fizz. Gin Fizz is a fresh and flowery chypre with lemony top notes over an aldehyde and musky base.The fragrance was first created in 1955 by celebrated perfumer Henri Giboulet as a tribute to Grace Kelly in the year she won an Oscar for her role in The Country Girl. The name is inspired by a cocktail that was in fashion at the time in the American bars of Paris, and was synonymous with joie de vivre and a fashionably festive lifestyle."," bergamot, lemon, mandarin, juniper berry, iris, galbanum, orange blossom, rose absolute, jasmine, lily, benzoin, vetiver, oak moss, white musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/31213.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Versilia Aurum Eau de Parfum,Profumi del Forte,"I practiced for a long time: I explored, smelt, created and discarded dozens of blends in my quest for a perfume that could evoke the spirit of that most noble of metals, gold. My Aurum is a jewel for the olfactory; to be worn with style on summer's sweetest evenings.The first impression is that of a colorful basket of fruit: A joyful spray of orange, strawberry, plum. But the heart is an infusion of flowers, with the warm notes of heliotrope, the sweetness of jasmine and the emotions of rose that lead to a light vanilla base, touched by the balsamic reflex of tolÃ¹ balsam and the precious sensuality of grey amber."," Orange, strawberry, plum, rose, jasmine, tuberose, lily of the valley, heliotrope, orchid, vanilla, tonka bean, perÃ¹ balsam, tolÃ¹ balsam, sandalwood, white musk, grey amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/53608.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, orange
Versilia Vintage Ambra Mediterranea Eau de Parfum,Profumi del Forte,"It was in the Sixties. During the summer I took a quiet ferry toward the islands of the archipelago. They were short trips in the search of those magnificent, solitary places set in the blue Tyrrhenian sea. In the small harbours, echos of fantastic stories, tales of distant lands, of flowers and perfumes; and merchandise of rich colours, of every kind and from every place. Then my journey continued on in my imagination, beyond the seas and the oceans, veering off through dream and discovery. They were the years of the New Frontier. The spirit of those times lives on, intact, in this perfume of mine.The elegance of grey amber and the serenity of orange. The sweetness of ylang-ylang, the warmth of cedar wood. Gentle luminous notes, which evoke atmospheres of a calm deep Meditereanean."," Orange, coriander, ylang-ylang, jasmine, grey amber, benzoin from Siam, tolu balsam, cedar wood, patchouli, vanilla, white musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/53609.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, orange
Arso Eau de Parfum,Profumum," The sharp, evocative scent of wood smoke  - triggering childhood memories of bonfires and burning leaves  - is at the heart of this eloquent scent. Arso meansburned and the masterfully rendered smokiness works with the crisp cool scent of pine to conjure up a cabin in winter, with a crackling fire on the hearth. You can sense the snow piling up outside, the ice on the windowpanes, the wildness of the forest and the chill kept at bay by the blaze, but you also get the warm indoor scents of well-worn leather and glowing incense, as well as the fire.  The mood is calm and comfortable and safe  sitting with a glass of wine and good company while the winds howl outside.  This is perfectly suited for the strong, silent type - the sort of man who could build a house single-handedly and maybe even chop down the trees to build all by himself. Quiet, reassuring and powerful."," Leather, incense, pine resin, cedar leaves",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/33931.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, leather
Fougere Royale Eau de Parfum,Houbigant," First introduced in 1882, FougÃ¨re Royale completely revolutionized the world of perfumes and established modern perfumery as we know it today. FougÃ¨re Royale was the firstfougÃ¨re (or fern-like) perfume ever created, and it established a completely new fragrance family, which remains the most popular one in men's fragrances.FougÃ¨re Royale opens with an uplifting cocktail of sparkling citrus oils, blending into an aromatic bouquet of Mediterranean herbs, where lavender and Moroccan chamomile oil dictate a buoyant tempo. A redolent heart follows, wherein a floral-spicy ""Rondeletia"" accord is revealed through rich geranium nuances and warm spices. A floral intermezzo showcases rare rose essences and absolutes, spiked with pepper, cinnamon and carnation. Finally, a grand finale of earthy, ambery and woody harmonies, with moss notes joining a sensual patchouli theme enriched by warm coumarinic undertones of tonka beans and clary sage absolute, conclude the aromatic symphony."," Bergamot, mediterranean herbs, lavender, chamomile, rondeletia, geranium, rose de Mai, cinnamon, carnation, amber, oakmoss, patchouli, tonka bean, clary sage",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/53400.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Antonia Parfum Extrait,Puredistance," The simplicity of the notes belie the perfection that is Antonia: a flawlessly executed performance in Green. Composed by Master perfumer Annie Buzantian for the ultra exclusive fragrance house Puredistance, Antonia is an essay on excellence. Dancing with graceful ease in a harmonious balance struck between the crisp, verdant optimism of galbanum top notes and the smooth, creamy sensuality of vanilla in the dry-down, Antonia recalls dreamy mid-summer days and the sun-dappled skin of reclining lovers' arms, enticing us, sotto voce:Come closer.Come closer we most certainly shall.This green goddess, laughingly pirouetting across the stage of hope-filled days of endless sunshine, has bewitched us with her sophisticated yet playful mien. An effortlessly superior fragrance, Antonia artfully demonstrates that the whole really is greater than the sum of its parts."," Jasmine, rose essence, ylang ylang, orris, ivy greens, galbanumb, vanilla, vetiver.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/53000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, jasmine
M Parfum Extrait,Puredistance," Created by Roja Dove, the world's only Professeur de Parfums and one of the biggest fragrance authorities, M is the first masculine scent from Puredistance. Inspired by the stylish comforts of the interior of an Aston Martin, this is a leather chypre of classic proportions... with an unexpected oriental twist, which lends the perfume an original and modern feel. The warm smoothness of the blend is incomparable. The composition purrs softly along, weaving the leather accord into the road-map of spices, woods and resins. The chic, sensual and comforting trip takes the wearer from the leathery start to the softly-smoldering woody, balsamic base via the delicately earthy heart. Enveloping and comforting as it is, M, with its elegantly smoky leather, has a hint of excitement and danger, which is just how it should be, in a fragrance inspired by Bond's car. Versatility is a sign of a great perfume, and M would fit any mood and situation...wear it to relax at home, to charm a date or to an important mission...and ask for your martini shaken, not stirred."," Bergamot, lemon, rose, jasmin, cinnamon, patchouli, moss, cistus, vetiver, vanilla, leather, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/53001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Vanille Insensee Cologne Absolue,Atelier Cologne," A deep, intense vanilla infused with wild, forest air. The opening is bright and invigorating, a delightful amouse-bouche of zesty lime and citron spiked with a delicious dose of coriander before the main course of rich, robust vanilla. This is not a sugary, whipped vanilla  this is creamy, satisfying and custard-like, with a comforting, subtle sweetness. The vanilla is laced with a fresh woodsiness  not just wood itself, but the whole sense of the forest - the crisp air, the layer of pine needles and leaves covering the earth and the rich earth, itself. Jasmine, oakmoss, oak wood and vetiver are expertly blended to give freshness and texture to the vanilla, and additional richness comes from the luscious amber which rounds out the fragrance. It does not feel like the elements are layered on top of each other, but fused seamlessly together, like someone discovered an enchanted vanilla forest and simply bottled the essence of it. A sophisticated take on a favorite note, suitable for vanilla fans of either gender.  Cologne Absolue Concentrated at 15%"," Lime, cedrat, coriander, jasmine, vetiver, oak moss, Madagascar vanilla, oak wood, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/51006.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, lime
Knize Ten Golden Edition Eau de Toilette,Knize," Gold adorns Knize Ten Golden Edition, the special composition Heinz Gottschalk launched to celebrate the 75th Anniversary of Knize Ten. The dry woody character of the historic fragrance is softened by more decisive floral notes, balanced out by spices and citrus to give it warmth and body, fruit of a truly special year."," Petitgrain, Orange, Rosemary, Bergamot, Lemon, Cedarwood, Sandalwood, Geranium, Iris, Rose, Carnation, Cinnamon, Leather, Ambergris, Musk, Moss, Vanilla, Castoreum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/52701.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, petitgrain
Two Eau de Toilette,Knize," A floral addition to the Knize family, Knize Two, created in 1978, is a fresh floral chypre with a beautiful, cut violet-leaf note singing in its heart. Clean and fresh but with minor-key notes that keep its melody interesting, Knize Two could help usher in spring with its sunny disposition.It opens with a green and slightly soapy accord offset by bitter-fresh galbanum and petitgrain, all of which is sharpened with bergamot and lemon. A subtle fruit note adds warmth to Knize Two's radiant florals, among them rose, jasmine, and carnation. Its woody/mossy drydown  with cedarwood, sandalwood, and musk  gives scratchy texture to the smooth and subtley lingering florals that shine through the base.A throwback to a time when a clean scent could have complexity and on the feminine side of unisex, Knize Two is reminiscent of Geoffrey Beene's classic Grey Flannel  if the latter were wearing a garland of flowers around its neck."," Bergamot, Lemon, Petitgrain, green notes, Galbanum, Iris, Violet, Jasmine, Carnation, Rose, Aldehydes, Cedarwood, Sandalwood, Moss, Tonka Bean, Musk, Ambergris",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/52703.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Via Camerelle Eau de Parfum,Carthusia," Back in the Nineteenth Century this street was a lane onto which opened what remained of forty rooms, created out of ancient Roman cisterns calledCamerelle. Via Camerelle captures the scents of the island of Capri, from the sea breeze to the blooming lemon groves. The bright top notes of bergamot, lemon and bitter orange are set against the warm herbaceous backdrop of marjoram. The transparent floral heart overlaid with cyclamen and jasmine segues into the weightless base of sheer woods and crisp amber. Refreshing and airy, Via Camerelle offers an olfactory stroll along the most famous of the island's shopping streets."," Lemon, bitter orange, marine notes, musk, cedarwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/52905.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, lemon
Carthusia Uomo Eau de Parfum,Carthusia," Fresh and leathery with a hint of spice, this is for the classic gentleman. Imagine a finely tailored Italian suit, a pair of classic leather oxfords, and a crisp white shirt slightly unbuttoned. Collar blowing in a wind filled with fresh sea air. This would be a first step to experiencing the refined masculinity of Carthusia Uomo. Discreet and distinct."," Citrus, cedar, kelp, cashmere, notes of sea air and essences of fruit",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/52907.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, citrus
Numero Uno Eau de Parfum,Carthusia," The aromas of Sicily comprise the exhilarating Carthusia fragrance, Numero Uno. The tart burst of sun ripened orange and bergamot is accented with the aromatic mist of lavender and thyme. A spicy heart of ylang ylang and violet set against the glow of patchouli is resting on a weightless chypre base of myrrh, vetiver and musk. At once elegant and assertive, Numero Uno captures vividly the beauty of the islands that inspired it."," Bergamot, Sicilian orange, lavender, thyme, eucalyptus, violet, ylang-ylang, patchouli, vetiver, myrrh and white musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/52908.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Craft Eau De Parfum,Andrea Maack Parfums," In the beginning, this is as sleek and impervious as the hideout of a Bond supervillian. Sharp aldehydes and frozen metal offer a chilly sophistication that feels like it's from a glossy version of the future that includes jet packs and robot valets. But under the slick ice is a warm and woody heart just waiting for the thaw - a blend of resinous elemi, earthy patchouli and robust cedar. The elemi note is particularly vivid -- this unique incense note has a clarifying briskness with undertones of fresh citrus and a hint of salt. The energizing incense and the cool metallic bite play together unexpectedly well, and what begins as a novelty evolves into a surprisingly wearable scent that has a wonderful balance of cool and warm that keeps it dynamic. A must-try for incense fans and for anyone who loves unusual fragrances."," Aldehydes, elemi, cold metal, ice, cedar wood, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/52800.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, aldehydes
Aventus Eau de Parfum,Creed," The exceptional Aventus was inspired by the dramatic life of a historic emperor, celebrating strength, power and success. Introduced in 2010 and crafted by the deft hand of Sixth Generation Master Perfumer Olivier Creed in collaboration with his son Erwin, this scent has grown to become the best-selling fragrance in the history of the brand. Olivier created its iconic name derived from A (""from"") ventus (""the wind""), illustrating the Aventus man as destined to live a driven life, ever galloping with the wind at his back toward success. Aventus is a sophisticated blend for individuals who savor a life well-lived. What We Think A phenomenon in its own right, Aventus is a fragrance that is groundbreaking in its use of bright apple and pineapple notes."," Bergamot, blackcurrant leaves, apple, pineapple, pinkberries, birch, patchouli, jasmine, musk, oakmoss, ambergris, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/49365.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Knize Ten Eau de Toilette,Knize," Joseph Knize, one of its inventors lived in Vienna and was a supplier to the Royal and Imperial Court. The fragrance we offer, Knize Ten, has been available since 1925. The great author Hans Habe once said that, if he were cast away on a desert island, he would take Knize with him, since, for a man using a toilet water, it was really not so much a matter of undermining the morale of a beautiful woman than boosting one's own. The brilliant designer and poster artist Ernst Deutsch-Dryden played a decisive role in the composition of Knize. Knize was the most famous men's outfitter in Vienna. His shop still exists today with a much-admired interior, one of the great works of the architect and designer Adolf Loos. Knize Ten is one of the few fragrances to have distinct note of leather. Perfumers, who are capable of lyricism equal to that of wine connoisseurs, differentiate between the top, heart and base note of a fragrance and sense chords and cadences in the combination of these three. The top note of Knize is citrus-fresh with petitgrain, orange, rosemary and bergamot; the heart note is dry to woody with cedars and sandalwood, and the base note is leathery with castor and ambergris. In view of its age, Knize is not, of course, a fully synthetic perfume. It contains costly natural substances - patchouli wood, lemon, orris, clove and orange blossom amongst others."," Lemon, bergamot, orange, petitgrain, rosemary,  geranium, rose, cedar, orris, carnation, cinnamon, orange blossom, sandalwood, leather, musk, moss, patchouli, ambergris, castoreum and vanilla.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/52700.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, lemon
Sartorial Eau de Toilette,Penhaligons," After offering the masterfully sensuous Amaranthine last year to the ladies, Penhaligon's, as befits a traditional English house, has turned its attention to gentlemen. As an inspiration for Sartorial, Bertrand Duchaufour launched into an olfactory exploration of the Savile Row bespoke tailor Norton & Son's workshop. The odorant threads he's teased out compose a radically new vision of the most traditional masculine fragrance family, the fougÃ¨re.  Lavender acts as a reference both to the fougÃ¨re and to a typically English scent. Boosted by aldehydes and ozonic materials, it conjures the steam rising from hot irons on tweeds  fear not, there isn't the least hint of the aquatic in the blend --, the scissors and sewing machines. The dusty leather of club chairs and mounted hunting trophies springs from the combination of black pepper, gurjum wood, oakmoss and a leather accord. Patchouli and cedar rubbed in beeswax and honey soften the hard edges of the leather and metallic effects and smoothly wrap the blend, just as the waxed floors and cupboards bathe the tailor's shop in a warm, fatty-animalic glow. Duchaufour aficionados may recognize a trace of that signature green pepper note he's dropped into many of his compositions.As the quintessential English dandy and couturier to the Queen Hardy Amies once said:A man should look as if he bought his clothes with intelligence, put them on with care, then forgot about them. That's Sartorial: tough and smooth, playful and elegant, impeccably tailored and as easy to wear as a bespoke suit."," Aldehydes, ozonic effect, metallic effect, violet leaf, neroli, cardamom, black pepper, fresh ginger, beeswax, cyclamen, linden blossom, lavender, leather, gurjum wood, patchouli, myrrh, cedar wood, tonka bean, oakmoss, white musk, honey effect, old wood effect, vanilla, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/44147.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, aldehydes
Une Rose Vermeille Eau de Parfum,Tauer Perfumes," A divinely saucy rose scent that flounces and shimmies and flirts its way into your heart and never lets you go. The opening is bright and juicy citrus with a hint of lavender  and then the vermillion rose unfurls its luscious petals. As you would expect from Andy Tauer, the rose is exceptionally vivid and true  deep and velvety and spicy, with a peppery bite that acts as the perfect foil to a delicious, intensely concentrated essence of raspberry. This is a raspberry that you would pick in a dream  the most perfect berry of the summer - so bright and pure and sweet that you would cry if you woke up before tasting another. The sparkling rose and raspberry jam is folded into a creamy base of vanilla, tonka bean and smooth sandalwood, taking us right to the brink of gourmand, but not quite crossing over. There is definitely an edible quality to Une Rose Vermeille  it conjures up marzipan and meringue and Bavarian cream  but it isn't pure dessert due to the startling freshness of the rose and the deep purr of the sandalwood. This rose is not just charming and delectable and adorably feminine, but a bit naughty, as well. Stunning."," lemon, bergamot, lavender, rose, raspberry, violet, vanilla, sandalwood, tonka bean, ambergris",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/31414.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, lemon
Cuir - Les Nombres d'Or Eau de Parfum,Mona di Orio," Rarely do leather scents come across our path that put us in a state of delightful shock. Opening with a whiff of Gauloise-like smoke it quickly becomes toasted spices and sweet absinthe before the appearance of the leather. Neatly straddling the line between biker and Birkin bag, the leather is almost carnal in its depth. In these days of anodyne scents and trans-fat free lives this is a welcome walk on the wild side that on a man would be wonderful. On a woman? The only way to put it: Cuir is ruthlessly chic."," Cardamom, Absinth, Leather, Cade, Resinoid Opoponax, Castoreum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/51700.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, cardamom
Musc - Les Nombres d'Or Eau de Parfum,Mona di Orio," Some musks are take-no-prisoners. Some are fleeting, or the scent of clean skin. Musc in Mona di Orio's deft hand is heartbreakingly lovely: the softest of rose, the most delicate of heliotrope, the most angelic of neroli. Were it a fairy tale it would be a princess, were it a character in a play it would be Juliet. The musk at the base of the scent implies the hidden carnality under all that radiant innocence, making it as captivating as it is unforgettable."," Neroli, Angelica, Rose, Heliotrope, Absolu Tonka Bean, Precious Musks",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/51701.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, neroli
Les Nuits d'Izu Eau de Parfum,Keiko Mecheri," Inspired by indigo nights on the Izu peninsula, the Riviera of Japan, this takes the classic cologne structure and gives it an Asian twist. It opens with a piquant, shimmering yuzu note  similar to that of grapefruit with overtones of Mandarin orange. The vibrant yuzu leads us like a colorful butterfly to an ethereal garden of rose japonica and dreamy jasmine. A base of ocean moss and hinoki, the Japanese cypress used for building shrines, palaces and the finest soaking baths, adds intrigue and depth. A fresh blend of tart citrus, delicate flowers and precious wood that delights the senses. Perfect for cologne lovers who are looking for something unusual and new."," Yuzu, Rose japonica, jasmine, littoral moss, hinoki, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/16463.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, yuzu
Uden Eau de Parfum,Xerjoff," Xerjoff classifies Uden as a marine fougere, meaning that it smells of lavender, oak moss, and the sea. To us, although accurate in some ways, it simplifies Uden's unique complexity. If Uden is a marine scent, then its waters surround the Bahamas, where ancient traders traveled weeks across the treacherous Atlantic to barter for coffee and rum, both of which give Uden a delicious warmth. The rum and coffee are then packed in rough wood crates, which pick up the salty scent of the ocean as the boat's wooden timbers rock on the waves for further journey in the New World. Uden's ocean is the world of the seamen who risked their lives traversing the seas to bring the pleasure of the exotic to long ago drawing rooms.Uden opens with lavender and citrus, the harbingers of a traditional fougere. However, instead of traveling the clean, smooth path for which it seems destined, coffee and rum absolutes add their familiar, delicious notes. Combined with Uden's opening, the coffee and rum create an unfamiliar--yet completely tantalizing--heart to the fragrance. Uden dries down into a warm medley of wood infused with clean musk, providing a counterpoint to its sweet rum, rich coffee, and crisp citrus-lavender. Uden reminds us that wild worlds may belie the simplest pleasures."," Grapefruit, lemon, rum absolute, rose, sandalwood, Gaiac wood, vanilla, coffee absolute, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/51105.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, grapefruit
Oolang Infini Cologne Absolue,Atelier Cologne," A full-bodied, exotic concoction featuring blue tea, bergamot and ethereal neroli huddled up next to the smoldering warmth of smoke and supple leather. This has a sitting-by-the-hearth coziness and a soft luxurious sweetness, with complex layers of richness courtesy of gaiac wood and Haitian vetiver. Stillthere is a crispness to the blue oolong tea and a hint of the chill winter air on the other side of the window which keeps the mystery alive. Mesmerizing and unique.Cologne Absolue concentrated at 15%"," bergamot, Tunisian neroli, oolang tea, jasmine petals, blond leather, tobacco flower, gaiac wood, Haitian vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/51002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Homme Eau de Parfum,Costume National," Cool, calm and collected.The perfect poet, discerning connoisseur, Dominique Ropion is an oxymoron all of his own. Master of his art, still modest in spite of his success, he has an additional quality, one that is almost outdated these days: his kindness. How does that fit in with perfumery? Only because it makes his talent even more remarkable... Dominique Ropion trained at the legendary Roure Bertrand Dupont laboratory before going to work with Jean-Louis Sieuzac, one of the perfumery world's great technicians. His work is special because of the tension between precision and freedom. Homme is a modern and mysterious scent. The fragrance opens with a very fresh head made of grapefruit, cardamom and bergamot. The essence then plunge into the spicy heart of Cinnamon, Thyme and Cloves. In the end, Patchouli, Sandalwood and Labdanum gave depth and warm the general accord.  Timeless yet seductive."," Grapefruit, cardamom, bergamot, cinnamon, thyme, cloves, patchouli, sandalwood, labdanum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/25808.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, grapefruit
Fleur Nocturne Eau de Parfum,Isabey," This Nocturnal Flower should've been called China Blue  or rather, Bleu de Chine  after the fragrance launched in 1925 by the house of Isabey, lodged in a China blue bottle designed by the legendary Julien Viard. But when Isabey's owners decided to re-launch the scent, the name Bleu de Chine had been snapped up by another brand. So Fleur Nocturne it is, for a fragrance as tight-grained and creamy-smooth as the most luxurious silk crepe, flowing on the sinuous silhouette of a 1930s film star, its delicate apricot hues lighting up petal-flesh skin. Like Isabey's previous scent Gardenia, Fleur Nocturne revives the opulence and full-blown glamour of classic French perfumery: an aromatic shimmer of mandarin melding into the fragrant juiciness of peach and apricot underlining the fruity facets of jasmine; the slightly soapy, lemony touch of magnolia balancing out the lazy Southern Belle lushness of gardenia. Solar notes add a powdery, tropical-flower tinge to the vanilla drydown, barely darkened by patchouli.With its ample, long-lasting sillage, Fleur Nocturne will sail you through nights as tender and glorious as a Scott Fitzgerald heroine in the Riviera moonlight."," Mandarin, apricot tree flower, white peach, jasmine, gardenia, magnolia, solar notes, vanilla, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/27101.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, mandarin
Aqua Universalis Eau de Toilette,Maison Francis Kurkdjian," The name is Latin for Universal Water, and the scent does what it says on the bottle. Francis Kurkdjian calls it the missing link between skin, clothes, bed linen and the air and he's spot on. This light, sparkling eau de toilette could be spritzed by anyone, anywhere, anytime  but you'll probably want to save it for your skin, since you can scent your house with the Aqua Universalis candle or incense paper, and launder your clothes with the matching detergent. With its sweet-as-a-kiss orange blossom and lily of the valley bouquet, brightened with citrus notes and a burst of aldehydes on a cottony cloud of white musks, Aqua Universalis is possibly the most refined interpretation ever of the fresh-out-of-the-shower, fresh-out-of-the-dryer smell. In a word, the ultimate stealth scent."," Bergamot, Sicilian lemon, lily of the valley, sweet mock orange, light and musky woods.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/49800.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Silver Mountain Water Eau de Parfum ...,Creed," The adventurous Silver Mountain Water evokes sparkling streams coursing through the snowcapped Swiss Alps, a bracing landscape in which Olivier Creed, a championship skier, finds relaxation and renewal. A bestseller since its launch, this modern scent captures the purity of the mountains-soft, milky-sweet blackcurrants mixed with green tea, the richness of bergamot, and sandalwood. Its opaque white bottle hints at icy snow banks topped with a glistening cap like a glacial silver stream."," Bergamot, mandarin, neroli, green tea, blackcurrant bud, sandalwood, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/49319.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Green Irish Tweed Eau de Parfum ...,Creed," A classic, as the old adage tells us, never goes out of style. Like a perfectly tailored suit, Green Irish Tweed has been and continues to be worn by confident men at the peak of their field. The fragrance elegantly combines woody freshness and pure masculinity, equally suited to a stroll through the Irish countryside and a strut down the red carpet. One of Creed's best-selling scents, to wear it is to be unforgettable."," Lemon, verbena from India, peppermint, violet leaves, Florentine iris, sandalwood, ambergris",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/49306.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, lemon
Himalaya Eau de Parfum ...,Creed," Fusing the power of man and nature, Himalaya was created to commemorate Master Perfumer Olivier Creed's daring climb in the beautiful but treacherous Himalayan Mountains. A seductive scent of citrus mixes with warmer notes of sandalwood and cedarwood to recreate the snowcapped Tibetan landscape. Presented in an attractive metallic bottle, co-designed with Erwin Creed, this fragrance is the embodiment of pure confidence and rugged masculinity, resembling a climber's canteen and the silvery look of alpine ice."," Bergamot, grapefruit, lemon, mandarin, pinkberries, nutmeg, cedarwood, sandalwood, vetiver, pepper, ambergris, musk, tonka bean",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/49308.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Patchouli Intense Eau de Parfum,PARFUMS DE NICOLAI,"Patchouli is a material of great importance in the perfumer's palette. It plays as first violin in the orchestra. Among all the woody notes, it is the most sensuous. Patchouli evokes richness, writes Patricia de NicolaÃ¯. With Patchouli Homme, the perfumer wanted to compose a woody oriental for men, but she ended up selling it to women too (which is why it will soon be renamed Patchouli Intense). And why not? This distinctly un-hippie patchouli straddles both sides of the olfactory gender spectrum, with Patricia de NicolaÃ¯ signature candied orange opening, sprinkled with cinnamon, sweetening the wedding of a deep, dark, earthy patch and its natural partner, rose. A passing quote of the fougÃ¨re family  lavender and geranium  lightens the heart of this heady blend before it subsides into an incense-laden, almost tarry leather drydown that plays up the smokier facets of vanilla. A sophisticated patchouli for dandies (both male and female) who aren't afraid of snagging a sleeve on a rose bush when they go out in the garden to pick their boutonniÃ¨re."," lavender, Turkish rose, geranium Bourbon, frankincense, sandalwood, bay oil, cinnamon, patchouli, leather, amber, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/31331.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, lavender
L'humaniste Eau de Parfum,Frapin," Like the refreshing aromatics of a classic gin and tonic, the zesty citrus top notes in L'humaniste command you to sit up and pay attention from the beginning. Delve deeper to discover a subtle spicy peppery heart tempered just enough with green notes of juniper and thyme. Genteel, refined, timeless."," Citrus, bergamot, cardamom, bay berry, black pepper, juniper, nutmeg, thyme, peony, gin, oakmoss, tonka bean",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/22607.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, citrus
Feminite du Bois Eau de Parfum,Serge Lutens," A milestone in the history of contemporary perfumery, FÃ©minitÃ© du Bois can be considered as the template of Serge Lutens' trademark woods, fruit and spices variations. As the stories goes, Lutens, who had yet to launch his Salons du Palais Royal line, dragged the Shiseido and Quest teams to Marrakech to make them understand just what he was after: the quintessence of Atlas cedar. Christopher Sheldrake was the one who caught on; the great Pierre Bourdon completed the formula. The result was a breakthrough in the world of women's fragrances: a dark, honeyed, animalic wood rubbed with candied fruit, sweet balms and the slow burn of spices, encrusted with the amethyst flash of violets. Today, FÃ©minitÃ© du Bois, the mother of all Lutens fragrances, has left Shiseido and found its true home. It has shed its strangely compelling dusty pink and plum flacon and Lutens has officially admitted that the formula was slightly tweaked to comply with new regulations, though he maintains thatthe quality (creative and olfactive) remains authentic. Aficionados may find the top notes a tad softer and the base a little muskier, but the fragrance is still entirely, deliciously FÃ©minitÃ© du Bois. A masterpiece."," Ginger, cinnamon, clove, plum, peach, orange blossom, violet, cedar, sandalwood, vanilla, benzoin",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36131.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, ginger
Oyedo Eau de Toilette,Diptyque," A vibrant and uplifting meditation on citrus, named in honor of Yedo (also known as Edo) the ancient name for Tokyo. A sparkling spritz of lemon and a squeeze of piquant green mandarine start things off with a jolt - fresh, realistic and dazzlingly bright. A delectable sweet orange joins in, dusted with sugar and nearly effervescent, and just when it seems like the whole thing might float off in a fizzy, candy-coated bubble, a bracing dash of cool thyme and tart tamarind keep Oyedo balanced and intriguing. Soft cedar wood acts as an anchor and adds a soothing and relaxing element to the shimmering citrus. This is a fragrance to calm frazzled nerves and lighten dark moods."," lemon, green mandarine, orange, tamarind, cedarwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/48310.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, lemon
Do Son - Eau de Toilette,Diptyque," Do Son is inspired directly from Yves Coueslant's childhood in Vietnam, where he grew up in HaÃ¯phong, a port in Northern Indo-China. Not far from there, in the little seaside resort of Do Son, his father had a pagoda built by the sea to go to and enjoy the sea air at the end of the day. Do Son recalls the memory of this place where flower fragrances dominate, in particular the tuberose, whose scent his mother particularly loves. In Do Son, the tuberose and Turkish rose bouquet expresses a sweet flavour freshened up with the orange blossom leaf and the rose berries. The white musk and the iris add a delicately powdered aspect to it."," tuberose, orange tree leaves, rose berries, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/48306.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, tuberose
Nobara-Cha roll-on Perfume Oil,Aroma M," In response to numerous clamorous requests, Aroma M announces the re-launch of one of her original eau de parfums, Geisha Nobara-Cha, as a perfume oil.The breathtaking opulence of a rose in full bloom is fused with rich incense. Unforgettable and striking -- like a gorgeous floral arrangement that uses a familiar flower in a completely unexpected, yet perfect way. While this formulation still recalls an overgrown field of wild roses and retains all of its flavors, refreshing notes of geranium flower grounded in soothing amber in their original proportions gives this fragrance a new potency in the absence of alcohol. Subtle in spite of the intensity of its elements, Nobara-Cha is seductive and unique."," rose, sandalwood, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/11127.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, rose
Tom of Finland Eau de Parfum,Etat Libre d'Orange," Created for the eponymous artist's Foundation, Tom of Finland, is an ode to masculine beauty. It is that rare marvel, a clean leather scent. There is no tar here, just a delightful hint of smoke that lingers over a clear watery accord, blending the tang of lemon with the sparkle of aldehydes. The fragrance enhances the perfume of one's freshly-showered skin, revealing the true sensual power of a wearer's own aroma. We adore the aromatic, forest-like aspect of the fragrance: birch, pine, cypress and galbanum are simultaneously reminiscent of the great outdoors and, surprisingly in such a modern creation, of some of the most elegant masculine scents of the past.

Yes I Do (formerly Don't Get Me Wrong Baby) Eau de Parfum,Etat Libre d'Orange," With its breezy lily of the valley, airy jasmine, clean orange blossom and lady-like aldehydes, Yes I Do is prim, proper and well-behaved. The Good Girl vibe of the scent is shocking given the suggestive name, and therein lies the genius of the fragrance. But is the girl really all that innocent? Under the angelic whiteness of cool florals, isn't there hidden a dark, edible, subtly animalic depth of patchouli, amber, cacao and marshmallows? Smell for yourself and find out. We already know how the story ends but we don't smell and tell."," Jasmine, aldehydes, lily of the valley, orange blossom, amber solar accord, patchouli, cacao, marshmallow.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/47706.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, jasmine
Vepres Siciliennes Eau de Parfum,Parfums MDCI," With VÃªpres Siciliennes, a verdant fruity chypre, Perfumer Jeanne-Marie Faugier embarks upon a different olfactory journey a journey to bella Italia. As the heat of the afternoon gives way to the early evening, it is a magical hour: Night is falling soon. The intoxicating smell of the orange orchards, still warm from the sun, rise up to meet the mysteries at hand for the evening, as lovers wait for the languor of evening shadows, and assassins heed the gathering darkness. Inspired by Verdi's opera of the same name, this fragrance honors the duality of man's nature the peaceful time of prayer and the uncertain dangers that await.The fragrance begins as a haunting, rich, lovely ode to an Italian tapestry of scent as we stroll through the orchard, with its smell of peppery citrus and crushed green leaves.  Unexpectedly we encounter scents drifting from a distant garden on the quiet breeze... the warm, sensual flowers of jasmine, magnolia, ylang ylang and heliotrope mingling with the earthy woods of cedar and oakmoss. The fragrance, like the day, then takes an unexpected twist-- instead of a drydown of woods, only then is the secret, surprising heart of the fragrance revealed: Fruits and flowers when we least expect it.  An early evening banquet is set out: Osmanthus, raspberry, clove, plum and peach entice us to linger, even as the shadows grow long beside us and the day grows still. It is the time for Vespers, and all is not what it seems.  An unexpectedly rich scent that evolves continually and delightfully for hours."," mandarin, grapefruit, peach, pepper, green leaves, cardamom, muguet, magnolia, jasmine, ylang ylang, rose, tuberose, heliotrope, osmanthus, raspberry, cloves, plum, coconut, musk, amber, oakmoss, cedarwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36508.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, mandarin
Sublime Balkiss Eau de Parfum,The Different Company," Balkiss was the name of the Queen of Sheba, the lover of King Solomon. But don't expect a spice-laden oriental. And though CÃ©line Ellena, who co-founded The Different Company along with her father Jean-Claude and legendary bottle designer Thierry de Baschmakoff, touts Sublime Balkiss as a chypre, don't expect a classic chypre either.The canonic bergamot-labdanum-oakmoss trilogy has been set aside and the scent retains only the structure of the chypre: mouthwatering bergamot, astringent cassis and blackberries stage the juicy, slightly raspy opening burst; damascene rose, lily of the valley and lilac provide the soft floral heart, with a lashing of green violet leaves and heather; two different types of patchouli grounding the composition. One is the traditional essence of patchouli; the other, more unusual one, is a fraction of patchouli essential oil, which brings out the cocoa facets of the heart notes (a chocolate-like effect similar in Serge Lutens' BornÃ©o 1834).With its berry top notes and patchouli base, Sublime Balkiss is sure to appeal to Angel fans  if you've given up on Thierry Mugler's classic because it was too popular, or too potent, you'll find the familar accord played in the lighter hand of the trademark Ellena style."," Bergamot, cassis, blackberries, rose, lily of the valley, violet leaf, lilac, patchouli fraction, patchouli essence, heather.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/25322.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Vanitas Eau de Parfum,Profumum," Just what we're always on the look-out for  a vanilla scent that is sophisticated and complex, but still delicious and comforting. Vanitas opens with a chilly dose of myrrh, which is almost medicinal at first, but as it warms on the skin, its deep, resinous sweetness emerges and blends with the creamy warmth of truly excellent vanilla. Delicate orange flower enhances the high notes, and sandalwood adds a dark golden bass line  but the heart of this accord is the exquisite pairing of vanilla and myrrh. The myrrh adds mystery to all the luscious qualities we love in vanilla and brings in a dark sweetness that is not at all food like. Happily, it adds just enough of a cool edge to keep things intriguing, but not enough to overpower our beloved vanilla.  Soft, enveloping and tantalizing - this is the grown-up vanilla we've dreamed about."," vanilla, myrrh, orange flower, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/33926.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, vanilla
Lyric for Women Eau de Parfum,Amouage," With Lyric Woman, Amouage is redefining the use of rose in perfume by rendering the traditional note in a completely unique manner. Spicy and resinous, Lyric Woman is an oriental rose, rich, complex and intricate. The piquant character of the composition is apparent immediately: the top notes blend bracing bergamot with tangy ginger and contrast this cool accord with warm, velvety spiciness of cardamom and cinnamon. The regal, crimson rose, surrounded by a creamy, opulent posse of ylang ylang, jasmine and orris, retains that spicy character in the heart of the fragrance, due to the presence of fiery geranium. The base of the scent, which includes the luxurious signature note of Amouage, frankincense, finishes the beautiful melody on a deep, sensual note. The drydown of woods, resins, vanilla and patchouli, paired with rose, is decadently rich, the epitome of Oriental luxury. In its structure, Lyric is a floral fragrance, but one that introduces a dark intensity and modernity not normally associated with this genre - a perfect illustration of femininity, strength and passion."," Bergamot, spicy cardamom, cinnamon, ginger, rose, angelica, jasmine, ylang-ylang, geranium, orris, oakmoss, musk, wood, patchouli, vetiver, sandalwood, vanilla, tonka bean, frankincense",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/41802.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot
Lyric for Men Eau de Parfum,Amouage," Lyric Man is the rarest of species- a masculine rose. Deep, daring and dangerous, this is a spicy, oriental rendition of the flower. Infused with angelica, pine and galbanum, the perfume has a striking green, earthy quality that makes it appear very classic, European and urbane. By contrast, the spices, nutmeg and saffron, and frankincense place the scent much further East, infusing it with the brooding sultriness that we find irresistible. The velvety accord of vanilla, sandalwood and musk, in the base of the scent, gives the fragrance unexpected softness. Audacious and harmonious, this is a rose like no other. Although undeniably masculine, the scent will be enjoyed by women who like dry, spicy, resinous florals."," Bergamot, lime, rose, angelica, orange blossom, green galbanum, spicy ginger, nutmeg, saffron, pine, sandalwood, vanilla, musk, frankincense",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/41803.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot

Rock Crystal Eau de Parfum,Olivier Durbano," Cristal de Roche (Rock Crystal) is the first of Durbano'sperfume poems,  an enigmatic scent inspired by the myth surrounding rock crystal and the magical,  mystical aura of frankincense.  Centuries ago,  rock crystal was thought to be ice that could not be melted; this mineral represents the link between man and nature,  the notion of man's place within the universe and the union of man with a higher force.  Frankincense,  a resinous substance venerated for centuries in places of worship,  is thought to carry prayers uttered by mortals towards the heavens. Durbano brings this to the forefront of Cristal de Roche,  as incense and resins of frankincense,  olibanum,  benzoin and myrrh rise like columns of deeply fragrant smoke to symbolise the joining of heaven and earth. A rich,  deep scent,  Cristal is not for the faint of heart; it's a marriage of moody woods,  deep incenses and dried spices,  a perfume for lovers of deep andchurchy fragrances  for those who love deep gold brocades and dark red satins versus crisp white linens and freshly starched cottons...for those who love the scented rituals of mankind in search of the divine."," orange, pepper, coriander, cardamom, cumin, olibanum, benzoin, myrrh, cistus, sandalwood, cedar, vetiver, everlasting flower, oakmoss, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36900.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, orange
Tuberosa Eau de Parfum,Profumum," We would call this a straightforward tuberose if it weren't for the fact that there is nothing straightforward about tuberose. Ever. It flirts, it teases, it beckons, it distracts, it wraps you around its little finger and whispers sweet nothings in your ear. It keeps you from concentrating on anything practical  and tries to convince you to run off for the weekend. This is tuberose at  her most bewitching heady and creamy and fresh, with a flourish of white jasmine and a tantalizing whisper of something warm and spicy that gives this a playfulness that many big florals lack. And make no mistake, this is a big floral. A big, flirtatious, impossible-to-resist floral that will make heads swivel. Outrageously feminine."," Tuberose, jasmine",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/33915.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, tuberose
Victrix Eau de Parfum,Profumum," An uplifting scent as crisp and refreshing as a cool wind whipping across an open field. The scintillating pink pepper opening is tamed with earthy vetiver, green laurel and fresh musk for a blend that speaks of broad stretches of undeveloped land and impossibly clean skies. Victrix has an elemental quality: a tingling spiciness that feels like a storm far off on the horizon; the mysterious dark, piny scent of a forest where no tree has ever been cut; the rough coolness of stark  expanses of earth and stone. Named for a legion of Ancient Rome, this has a nobility and strength that speaks to another time, but the insistent bite of pepper keeps this thoroughly modern and completely compelling. Commanding and masculine."," Pink pepper, vetiver, laurel, coriander, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/33916.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, pink pepper
Promesse de l'Aube Eau de Parfum,Parfums MDCI," Francis  Kurkdjian's first creation for MDCI, Promesse de l'Aube is a scent for the morning,a classical and refined oriental-floral. Its top notes of mandarin and lemon are fresh, and have a joyful, flirty, sun-kissed feel. The citruses have a candied quality, which teasingly hints at the delicious sweetness, but never steps into the realm of the gourmand. The heart of the composition is a luxurious, creamy bouquet of ylang-ylang and jasmine. It is languid, summery, warmed by the tropical sun. The base features a gorgeous blend of velvety sandalwood sweetened and softened by vanilla. The scent combines playfulness, the allusion to the tropical exoticism with the supremely elegant, urban side. We are absolutely smitten with this charming fragrance and know that you will be too."," Mandarin, lemon, ylang-ylang, jasmine, sandalwood, tonka bean and vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36500.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, mandarin
Ambre Topkapi Eau de Parfum,Parfums MDCI," Created by the renowned perfumer Pierre Bourdon, the first MDCI fragrance for men, Ambre Topkapi was meant to embody strength, power and wealth, and was inspired by the striking figure crowning the men's flacon. The scent, with its bracing and strapping notes, is forceful and daring. We admire the way the tradition and modernity meet and intertwine in this handsome, truly regal composition. The top notes are the perfumer's nod to the classic masculine scents: the beginning of Ambre Topkapi is brightened by bergamot, spiced up by ginger and have a cool, herbal undertone of basil, thyme and lavender. The heart notes, with their combination of luxurious leather and soft, sweet sandalwood, add depth, warmth and what we can only described as a veryexpensive feel to the blend. In the base, vanilla and amber ornament the scent beautifully, bringing to it a wonderfully exotic feel, making it evocative of faraway lands, luxurious palaces, and Eastern splendor. This unexpected exoticism is where the traditional meets modern. This ambery-vanillic warmth is also what should make Ambre Topkapi wearable for women as well as for men."," Bergamot, grapefruit, pineapple, melon, cinnamon, cardamom, nutmeg ginger, basil, thyme, lavender, oak moss, vetiver, sandalwood, rosewood, leather, Darjeeling tea, amber, musk, vanilla, jasmine and violet.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36503.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, bergamot

Like that Perfect Man', Invasion Barbare combines elegant understatement with lots of warmth and an unexpected, mesmerizing depth. The composition is built on the contrast of freshness and warmth, on the intriguing balance of citrus fruits, lavender, spices and vanilla and woods. Invasion Barbare is a tranquil, comforting scent, as soft as it is piquant. It is a soft-spoken fragrance, there is nothing overly forceful about it, and yet it is full  of charisma. One gentle whiff of its delicately-spiced notes and we are enthralled.

It's more like the pure distilled essence of a true vanilla bean pod than the wafer cookie vanillas that have flooded the market in the last few years, but make no mistake: this beauty flaunts its sweet depths with wild abandon and really doesn't care who's looking. A refined vanilla without being snooty, we can think of several perfumes that trumpetvanilla in their name then try to bury the note under a pile of florals or other notes in an effort to beclassy.  Montale got it right  there's a reason so many of us love the smell of vanilla, and Vanille Absolu is it.  It's one of the best pure, elegant vanillas on the market. Period."," vanilla, cinnamon, clove, woods",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/35401.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, vanilla

Geisha Marron roll-on Perfume Oil,Aroma M," Geisha Marron takes its inspiration not only from the scent of chestnut blossoms, but also from that even more widespread flavor of spring... of white flowers and to musk brown (marron, in French). Brown is surely the most underserved color in all of perfumery.  More than any other, it evokes the musty scent of succulent overripeness, of sweetness that dares to skirt the edge of seductive decay. That is Geisha Marron's most unique quality."," grapefruit, mandarin, bergamot, muguet, japanese magnolia, chestnut blossom (white flower)",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/11124.jpg?width=400&404=product.png, grapefruit

The ephemeral beauty of orange blossom- an especially lovely and true orange blossom, by the way- is dipped in vanilla and sugar and laced with a dash of just-on-the-verge-of-tart wild berries. As airy as a meringue, as fragile as first love, this feels like honey melting in your mouth. But don't worry- although this captures the sensation of fleeting beauty, the fragrance itself isn't fleeting.

A vibrant citrus note mingles with the subtle sweetness of almond on a warm base of wood. The result is clean, but in a comforting and luxurious way not at all astringent or antiseptic.

Vanille Tonka Eau de Parfum,PARFUMS DE NICOLAI," Creamy vanilla and rich tonka get top billing here, but there's another key player in this spellbinding scent: dark and mysterious frankincense, which firmly steers the vanilla away from the bakery and into an opulent hookah bar upholstered in deep brown velvet. Opening with a tingle of sharp lime and tangerine, this unfurls into a cinnamon-laced, smoky vanilla that makes us deliriously happy. A voluptuous and adult vanilla, a vanilla that has been around the block, a vanilla that has nothing to do with cupcakes.

Simply put, this smells incredibly good.  Mellow, polished, deep, spicy, complex and seductive.

FRANK No. 2 Eau de Parfum,FRANK los angeles," A smooth, confident blend with a playful side. Opening briskly, with bergamot and white lavender taking the lead, the first whiff is seemingly all business.  But then we take a few detours along the way on the way to the office     dark espresso, warm and sensuous plum, a bit of fire in the belly from some cognac  and we wonder if we are going to work after all. Perhaps we are going to end up in a leather armchair in a wood paneled room in front of a roaring fire, instead.   A mellow melange of wood and warm spice, with a touch of autumnal sweetness  this has the comfortable ease of a classic. Rich and full, but easy to wear.
